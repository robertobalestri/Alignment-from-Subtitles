1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,564
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:13,337
I'm a third-year resident, and the
tube gauze is in Exam 2, center cabinet.

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,538
Thanks.

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,014
In my line of work I
see you guys get hurt.

5
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,947
So you worry about me.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,617
This disease is
invariably fatal.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,623
Well, there must be some sort of
experimental treatments, right? Trials?

8
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,818
But it's so quiet
with Luka away.

9
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,793
And I could use
some free babysitting.

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,332
I guess Joe needs to get
to know his Auntie Neela.

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,604
Come on.

12
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:43,937
Come on.

13
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,945
Oh, Joe, eat some food.

14
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,743
No? Come on, you love bananas.

15
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,919
Come on. No? Eat some of these.

16
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:57,190
- Come on.
- Want me to get that?

17
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:02,261
Um, no, it's probably Tanya
calling to say she's stuck in traffic.

18
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,521
Hello?

19
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:08,794
Hi, Tanya. I was just gonna call you.
- Hi, Joe.

20
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,198
The doctor?

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,230
Well, you didn't
tell me he was sick.

22
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,301
No, no, no. Of
course, of course.

23
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,979
No, I understand, you should.

24
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,240
I'll just, um... I'll
call my neighbor.

25
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,578
Okay, let me know
how he's doing.

26
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,889
Her kid has pneumonia.
She might be out all week.

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,484
- Well, what are you doing?
- I am looking for...

28
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,791
um, Miriam's number.

29
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,125
- Maybe she can watch Joe.
- I'll watch Joe.

30
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:41,791
I don't... You know, I
swear I had it on the fridge.

31
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,301
I'm serious. I'll watch Joe.

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,235
I don't need you to watch
Joe. I need to find the number.

33
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,068
- You're having a meltdown.
- I'm not.

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,302
Meltdown involves throwing
things. This is like a pre-meltdown.

35
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,448
You know, sorry, sorry.

36
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,516
I get... I get that Luka's
father had surgery, all right?

37
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,121
But the chemo could take, like,
six months, and we have a life here.

38
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,688
Joe could be walking soon.

39
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,118
Meltdown. I'll watch Joe.

40
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,815
No, you need to rest.

41
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,687
I'm fine, look.

42
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,591
See?

43
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,992
He... I know he loves me.

44
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,759
He loves me, he loves me. Joe.

45
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,932
Oh, baby.

46
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,638
That was nice.

47
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,805
- Mmm. Yeah, really nice.
- Oh, baby.

48
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,675
Mmm.

49
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,849
We should get to work.

50
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,117
Why? What's up?

51
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,385
Nothing.

52
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,131
Hey, what's up?

53
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,359
I'm fine.

54
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,026
Come on, what?

55
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,865
What, you didn't...?

56
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,008
Of course I did.

57
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,805
Bettina, you didn't.

58
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,546
Okay, so I didn't.

59
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,653
But it's no big deal.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,618
Come here.

61
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:12,688
No. No, no.

62
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,828
Wait, wait, wait.

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,157
Look, I know this is
hard to talk about, okay?

64
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,423
Greg, let it go.

65
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,101
If you didn't have one,
why would you say you did?

66
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,066
I'm a woman, it's easier.

67
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,329
It's easier to lie?

68
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,497
- Well, kind of.
- What's "kind of" supposed to mean?

69
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,905
Dr. Pratt, we got a
syncopal kid over here.

70
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,943
Go. We'll talk about it later.

71
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,411
Sixteen-year-old, passed out after
two days of vomiting and diarrhea.

72
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,050
- Where's Moretti?
- Conference.

73
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,379
- You and Morris are running the floor.
- Okay.

74
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,419
Finn Andrews, 16.
No evidence of trauma.

75
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,922
- Pulse, 122, BP's 93/45.
- There's a bug going around his school.

76
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,892
Access? DAWN:
Twenty gauge in the hand.

77
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,518
- Any medical history?
- I'm okay.

78
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,630
- My son's always been healthy.
- Let's go.

79
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,926
I'm Dr. Pratt. Probably just
dehydration from a stomach virus.

80
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,604
All right, so you're not enrolling
the pediatric cohort now, I got that.

81
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,765
No, listen, this kid would
be perfect for the IGF-1 trial.

82
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,639
You're not listening here.
That's not good enough.

83
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,280
He doesn't have
six months, okay?

84
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,609
No, I want you to have
Dr. Subrin call me...

85
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,378
and I wanna hear
it from him. Got it?

86
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,294
- Sarah.
- Tony?

87
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,764
What are you doing here?

88
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,595
- I ran away.
- What?

89
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,045
What's the matter with you?

90
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,514
I told you I was gonna
come visit you, didn't I?

91
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,619
Yeah, but I couldn't
wait that long.

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,652
You know what could've
happened to you?

93
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,984
- I'm fine.
- You're fine, yeah, you're fine now.

94
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,286
Your grandparents are
probably worried about you.

95
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,985
Don't call them.

96
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,960
Please, Tony?

97
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,622
I told them that I was
having a sleepover at Janet's.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,359
Janet's in on this too?

99
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,370
I told them we were going to the mall
today and I was staying there last night.

100
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,134
Sarah, you're killing me. I
have to be at work right now.

101
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,472
- I'll come with you, we can talk there.
- No, stay here, okay?

102
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,080
Stay here, I'll call you
later, we'll discuss this.

103
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,374
Stay here.

104
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,814
And lock the door.

105
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,031
<i>We're five minutes out.</i>

106
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,217
Copy that, 42's, repeat vitals.

107
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,485
<i>- One-thirty/80.</i>
- We'll see you in five.

108
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,925
Double trauma on the
way. GSWs, belly and chest.

109
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,587
- One's shocky, they're cops.
- Clear the trauma rooms.

110
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,596
Alert the blood bank and O.R.
- Got it.

111
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,269
Dr. Morris, I got a pregnant
woman I need to present.

112
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,531
The guy that picked up arteritis
on a lady with an earache.

113
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,698
- I'll hear anything.
- Morris, line two.

114
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,207
Well, take a message.

115
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,708
It's your cousin from Iowa.

116
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,608
- Says it's important.
- Give it to me.

117
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,714
I got 29-weeker with
vomiting, abdominal pain.

118
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,283
Bolus a liter of NS, page
OB. Meet me outside.

119
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,612
Double trauma coming in.

120
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,788
Don't tell me you got
another DUI, Johnny.

121
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,446
Now even Randi's not available.

122
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,182
- Why don't you call Jerry?
- What?

123
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,088
Didn't you hear?
He moved to Alaska.

124
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,695
- He's slinging beer outside Anchorage.
- No way.

125
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,765
- Well, then you're on your own.
- No duh.

126
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,128
I can't believe this.

127
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,394
A thousand cc's in.

128
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,731
Let's hang another
liter. Feeling any better?

129
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,774
No, not really. I have a wrestling
match next week. I need to get better.

130
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,275
You think I should
call his father in Ohio?

131
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,778
- He could get here in a few hours.
- My chest feels funny.

132
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,939
What, you're having pain?
- It's pretty bad.

133
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,946
He's in V-tach.

134
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,280
- No carotid, lost a pulse.
- Charge to 360.

135
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,286
- What's happening?
- Clear.

136
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,783
- Still V-tach.
- Starting compressions, charge again.

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,452
- Finn, please wake up.
- Stand by with epi.

138
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,434
Lockhart, I need
you to jump on this.

139
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,232
Morning to you too.

140
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,836
Are you all right?

141
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,568
I'm fine.

142
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,942
We got two auxiliary cops down.

143
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,983
- What the hell is that?
- They're volunteers of our precinct.

144
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,779
- Who's with me on this?
- Grady.

145
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,948
I don't know if it's
a case for an intern.

146
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:02,972
It's a great case.

147
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,291
- What about Pratt?
- Busy with a kid in V-tach.

148
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,483
We'll be fine.

149
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,756
Through and through GSW to
the right upper quadrant, 90/62.

150
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,455
Tachy at 120 after a liter.

151
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,624
- How's the other one?
- Stable chest wound.

152
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,895
Larry, you're with me.
You two, chest wound.

153
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:25,402
Left lateral chest. Twenty-two
caliber casing at the scene.

154
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,774
Vitals? DUMAR: BP
came up to 110 after a liter.

155
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,347
All right, Grady,
what's the pulse ox?

156
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,009
- Oh, I don't... It's not picking up.
- Move the probe.

157
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,122
It hurts like hell. - Let's go.

158
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,456
Systolic's 120 with
the second liter.

159
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,650
C-spine is non-tender.

160
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,820
No elevated JVD. They let
you guys work without vests?

161
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,296
No guns, no vests.
We're volunteers.

162
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,333
- Breath sounds equal.
- Will you be quiet?

163
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,802
It's a way for some of us to
get in. And others, to give back.

164
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,465
- HemoCue, 13.2.
- I don't know what happened.

165
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,635
We were just walking our beat.

166
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,407
We came across this
guy. Ow. He looked wrong.

167
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,380
Exit wound near
the inferior scapula.

168
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,349
- Grady, set up the Thora-Seal.
- Uh, right.

169
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,420
- It's in the cabinet.
- Second line's in.

170
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,318
He was trying to
carjack some woman.

171
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,549
He had a gun to her.

172
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,718
And he was pulling
her out of her car.

173
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,829
Belly's soft, non-distended.
Femoral pulses, two plus.

174
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,762
They told us in training.

175
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,832
If we ever saw
someone with a gun...

176
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,668
Not to get involved. Ow.

177
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,466
Hang another liter of NS.

178
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,104
But what were we gonna do?

179
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,174
Grady, the cabinet
underneath the sink.

180
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,245
Could have been a
kid inside. Who knows?

181
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,382
Other sink.

182
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,679
Decreased breath
sounds on the left.

183
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,218
- What's that mean?
- Probably has a collapsed lung.

184
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:42,185
X-ray's back.

185
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,385
Um, lungs down, hemopneumo.

186
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,117
- Chest tube tray.
- Got it ready.

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,522
I can... Can I put it in?

188
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,255
Yeah.

189
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,730
We need your arm
up here like that.

190
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,631
All set,
seven-and-a-half gloves.

191
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,796
Yeah, that tube's not sterile.
- What?

192
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,770
You just contaminated
the whole tray.

193
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,536
- I'll get another one.
- Right, sorry.

194
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,104
Just get your gloves on.

195
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,313
- Hey, Josh.
- Come on, come on.

196
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,952
How's it going?

197
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,384
- The Cubs are down two in the ninth.
- Oh, yeah?

198
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,753
Columbia is enrolling patients
into a minocycline study.

199
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,394
Did I tell you my mom's
applying to medical school?

200
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,223
I talked to the guys at Hopkins.

201
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,592
We're trying to get
you into the IGF-1 trial.

202
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,028
IGF-1, what's that?

203
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,099
Insulin-like growth factor.

204
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,238
Yeah, it could protect
the nerve cells...

205
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,566
and slow down the
progression of the disease.

206
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,641
- When can he start?
- Soon, I hope.

207
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,142
I just have to get
through some red tape.

208
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,780
I'm working that out.

209
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,041
Oh, that's wonderful.

210
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,118
All right, I have to
make my rounds.

211
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,312
You, uh... Here, take this.

212
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,548
Keep your weight up and
keep you off the vent, okay?

213
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,198
- Coming in.
- Is Goldstein okay?

214
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,925
Okay, widen the
hole for the tube.

215
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,670
She caught the worst of it.

216
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,865
She's only been out
there for three months.

217
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,474
- Okay.
- Aim for the apex.

218
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,076
Second HemoCue's 13.

219
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,775
It just goes in a few
centimeters, then stops.

220
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,281
Okay, because you're
tracking under the muscle.

221
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,614
You wanna get in
between the ribs.

222
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,356
- It just doesn't wanna go through.
- Relax, use your finger to guide it in.

223
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,126
- Why don't you just do it?
- No, go ahead, keep trying, go.

224
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,492
He's killing me.

225
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,898
- You did fine with Moretti last week.
- I know, it's just she makes me nervous.

226
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,298
Me?

227
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,170
Forget it. I shouldn't
have said anything.

228
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,876
The inflammation of his pancreas
caused his calcium level to drop.

229
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,480
That's why his heart stopped?

230
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,214
But he'll get better?

231
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,410
Yeah, but pancreatitis is
rare for someone his age.

232
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,219
It's often associated with
excessive alcohol use.

233
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,662
I don't drink.

234
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,162
Well, does anybody in
your family have gallstones?

235
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,528
Not that I've ever heard about.

236
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,932
Whoa. Hey, wait, look at this.

237
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,072
See this area of black?

238
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,734
It looks like there's a cyst
in the pancreas and it's big.

239
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,846
- Should I take him for a formal scan?
- No, he's too unstable.

240
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,676
I don't wanna risk another
bout of V-tach off the floor.

241
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,183
Page Radiology to come do an
ultrasound and get Surgery down here.

242
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:31,118
Good chest-tube placement, sats
are down, decreased breath sounds.

243
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,260
Something's not right.
What would you do?

244
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,521
There's a clot. Strip the
tubing, it might clear obstruction.

245
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,925
Yeah, good, do it.

246
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,659
I think he needs a
second chest tube.

247
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,270
Sats are up to 96.

248
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,865
Looks like it was a clot.

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,906
Always a good
thing to check, Abby.

250
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,972
Why am I coughing?

251
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,943
- Your lung's expanding, that's good.
- So he's okay now?

252
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,982
If there's not much bleeding,
we could put the tube back in.

253
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,277
And his lung will heal.

254
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,320
- Dr. Morris, can't get a BP here.
- Okay, move him to Exam 2.

255
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,720
Repeat portable chest
and set up for ultrasound.

256
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,396
Why didn't you mention
the tubing earlier?

257
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,964
I didn't think of it
until Dr. Morris asked.

258
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,394
You make me nervous.

259
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,403
We have to work together
without you getting brain freeze.

260
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,906
Works fine when you're not in the room.
- I'm gonna be in the room.

261
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,669
Figure out a way to handle it.

262
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,109
- Will you stop yelling at me?
- I'm not yelling.

263
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,772
- I am trying to teach you.
- Your tone's not helping.

264
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,180
- Wanna be breastfed?
- Abby, I need you in here.

265
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,479
Get on your game.

266
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,814
- I'm trying.
- Try harder.

267
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,479
Get in here.

268
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,126
- Got a flash. GRADY:
Saline's primed and ready.

269
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,286
Right upper quadrant is soft.
Liver hematoma is not impressive.

270
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,091
Something else is going on.

271
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,928
Liver looks stable.
Spleen is good.

272
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,660
Pelvic view is unremarkable.

273
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,169
Subclavian's in.
Let's hang a unit here.

274
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,137
- Could be an allergic reaction?
- She didn't get anything.

275
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,174
Set up for intubation, 80 tube?

276
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,863
- Mind if I try?
- Don't start yet.

277
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,946
Mach tube, suction.
Have the bag ready.

278
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,309
This is Sergeant O'Malley.

279
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,611
- She runs the auxiliary program.
- Lauren and Tim are my trainees.

280
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,778
- Need an extra set of hands?
- No, it's crowded enough already.

281
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,254
- Bag her up, guys.
- Is she gonna be okay?

282
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,859
She would be, if you
guys had given her a vest.

283
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,621
It's not in the budget.
They're neighborhood patrol.

284
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,290
- They're just supposed to call in.
- Well, they didn't.

285
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:25,131
You put them out there with nothing,
didn't back them, didn't support them.

286
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,274
- Not her fault, Morris.
- Of course it is.

287
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,103
Would you send a soldier to
war without the right armor?

288
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,505
Oh, wait, we did that too.

289
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,307
You don't need to
make me feel any worse.

290
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,641
These are like my kids.

291
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,181
Well, you didn't
look out for them.

292
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,623
- Nice work.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

293
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,821
What's happening?
What's going on?

294
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,863
Systolic's up to 130.

295
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,969
- Hemoglobin steady at 12.9.
- Your crashing patient isn't crashing.

296
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,639
She was completely unstable.

297
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,707
- When did her BP drop?
- Ten minutes ago.

298
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,504
- Mm-hm. What were you doing?
- Starting a second line.

299
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,373
- It was all vagal.
- Wait, my blood pressure dropped?

300
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,988
Yes, some people get low blood
pressure when they're stuck by a needle.

301
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,680
I fainted the last two
times I gave blood.

302
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,485
Try taking a better history.

303
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,395
I prefer not to get paged
because a patient swoons.

304
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,359
- She was unconscious.
- Hey, how's Neela?

305
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,931
She's drinking all my coffee.

306
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,693
Maybe I'll stop by
and see her later.

307
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,506
He's got a large pseudocyst
obstructing the duct.

308
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,702
- It needs to be drained immediately.
- Okay.

309
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,211
- Dawn, could you call Surgery again?
- Right away.

310
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,350
- Thank you.
- I'm having an operation?

311
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:47,385
- Yeah, we need to get rid of that fluid.
- Actually, Dr. Pratt, can I...?

312
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,612
Yeah.

313
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,347
Excuse me.

314
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,955
- Um...
- Yes?

315
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,595
These can be drained internally
with endoscopic ultrasound.

316
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,289
I'm between cases and
would be happy to do it.

317
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,899
I never heard of that before.

318
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,698
We did a study, the complication
risk is lower than an external drainage.

319
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:10,310
I see. And how do I know that
you're not just faking your data?

320
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,141
One-point-four-percent complication
rate for endoscopic drainage...

321
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,442
versus 18 percent
if done externally.

322
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:20,212
Are you gonna let me
do this procedure or not?

323
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,252
Do your thing.

324
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,156
Dr. Pratt, 32-year-old male.

325
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,225
Single GSW to the left thigh.

326
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,419
- Get off of me.
- Hey, shut up already.

327
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,928
- He shot the auxiliary cops.
- Get me out of here.

328
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,260
These guys are gonna kill me.
- His vitals?

329
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,403
Tachy to 118. BP, 155/84.

330
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,129
- Did you give him any pain meds?
- Nobody gave me jack.

331
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,740
All right, hey, Sam, I
need CBC, type and cross...

332
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,139
five of morphine and
bolus a liter of NS.

333
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,075
- Okay, come on, let's go.
- Dawn, will you jump on this?

334
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,116
Uh, you, you come with me.

335
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,425
Hey, Morris, this
is for that consent.

336
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,159
Yeah.

337
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,166
We sent Lauren to CT.

338
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,611
Make sure there's
no internal bleeding.

339
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:24,717
Good, that's good.

340
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,321
Tim seems stable, but
we need to observe him.

341
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,454
It shouldn't have happened.

342
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,051
Lauren just started.

343
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,389
Tim hasn't even been
with us six months.

344
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,867
How long has the
program been around?

345
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,364
A year. I saw it work in New
York, I thought it'd be good here.

346
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,271
Took Lauren under my wing.

347
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:54,675
Tim, pfft, I found him lying in
the middle of Halstead one night...

348
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,475
crashing from meth.

349
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,676
I told him to go home,
he didn't have one.

350
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,054
When I started the
program, he wanted to join.

351
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:07,056
Who better to clean up the streets
than someone who knew them?

352
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,528
Well, hopefully,
they'll pull through.

353
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,031
- Lou.
- How they doing?

354
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,863
The mayor's office
wants an update.

355
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,403
When Lauren comes back down from
CT, we'll wanna monitor her closely.

356
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,372
- We're gonna admit her for observation.
- For how long?

357
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,240
- A couple of days, maybe more...
- Hey, get out of the way.

358
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,746
Dr. Morris, expanding liver hematoma
and her pressure dropped again.

359
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,211
- Sure it's not vagal again?
- No procedures, no new needle sticks.

360
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,382
Okay, get me the ultrasound.

361
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,051
Dropped her crit to nine.
- From 13?

362
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,857
- It's the girl's father.
- Oh, my God, Lauren, baby?

363
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,523
Run in two units. Larry, get
Dubenko back down here.

364
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,532
- How'd this happen?
- She was on patrol.

365
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,137
- There was a carjacking...
- What do you mean patrol?

366
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:53,931
Your daughter is
a volunteer cop.

367
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,473
What the hell is that?
She's a college student.

368
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,339
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hanging the blood.

369
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,038
You opened your line to
the saline, not to the patient.

370
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,240
- She's not getting any of it.
- Okay.

371
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,078
Come on.

372
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,379
Dr. Lockhart, I think...

373
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,045
Fix the blood, go outside,
then work on your charts.

374
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,315
He can stay, he'll learn.

375
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,101
Is my daughter gonna be okay?

376
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,287
Hematoma doesn't
explain the big drop in crit.

377
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,259
- I agree, spleen's intact...
- I swear...

378
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,241
- Is my daughter okay?
- Tachy at 120.

379
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,461
- Let's take a look at...
- Somebody answer me.

380
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,365
- We don't know, now move back!
- Okay, come on. Shh!

381
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,869
Morris, look, she's oozing
from the old IV sites.

382
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:29,906
Coagulopathy.

383
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,635
I've been trying
to tell you that.

384
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,438
Okay, send off platelets
and a DIC screen.

385
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,108
You've gotta be bold in trauma room.
You have something to say, speak up.

386
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,083
We got the shooter
in the other room.

387
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,620
Dr. Pratt is asking for
another set of hands.

388
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,758
- I'll go.
- No, I'll take it.

389
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,622
I think you guys got
this under control.

390
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,188
See, this is why I
don't like to date cops.

391
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:56,699
You never know when they're gonna
be in a shootout with some scumbag.

392
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,336
I never shot anyone before.

393
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,303
Yeah, well, you should've
killed that guy for what he did.

394
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,171
Yeah, well, it's not that
easy, Sam, pulling the trigger.

395
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,642
Even if it is the right thing.

396
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,543
Yeah, I know.

397
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,280
I know it's not.

398
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,818
Yeah, they're gonna take my gun
away, make me talk to some shrink.

399
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,948
That's just protocol.

400
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,388
You are gonna be back
on the streets in a week.

401
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,459
Yeah, you're right.

402
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,988
- Oh, sorry.
- What's up?

403
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:28,293
You have a emphysemic on
BiPAP coming up to the unit?

404
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,368
Oh, yeah, I got the chart.

405
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,368
You know, I'll be
right back with you.

406
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,370
Were you sucking
face with Barney Fife?

407
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,532
No, for information
about the shooting...

408
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,076
you need to contact our
media-relations office.

409
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,873
- Here's the emphysemic.
- Thanks.

410
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,881
- Hey, your kid's 14, right?
- Yeah.

411
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,484
I got a hypothetical for you.

412
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,883
Say he ran away, right, across
state line to a friend's house...

413
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,718
do you know how much
trouble that friend would be in?

414
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,655
- Hypothetically?
- Yeah, for instance.

415
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,819
Good, because I thought Sarah
ran away from her grandparents...

416
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,589
and she's at your house.

417
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,859
- All right, we'll talk about this later.
- Tony, send her home.

418
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,369
Dr. Dubenko, I heard that you did
your trauma fellowship at Hopkins, right?

419
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,668
- Not a good time, I'm busy.
- You know Dillon Subrin in Neurology?

420
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,539
We got wounded cops. We
got a shooter in the other room.

421
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,080
Your friend's the head of the IGF-1
trial, and they closed enrollment.

422
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,547
I have this kid up in ICU.
Nice kid, single mom...

423
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,710
- What happened? MORRIS:
This time, it's for real.

424
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,514
Dropped her
pressure and her crit.

425
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,919
Call upstairs, tell them
to get an O.R. ready.

426
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,252
There's another problem.

427
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,553
DIC. She needs
fresh frozen plasma.

428
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,128
I'll give her FFP in surgery.

429
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,958
Hold on, the PT
and PTT are normal.

430
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,225
It's not really consistent
with a DIC, now, is it?

431
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,266
Could be a dilutional
coagulopathy.

432
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,459
Or platelet problem?

433
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,070
No, her count's over 300,000.

434
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,436
Plenty, but they might be bad
platelets. Maybe they can't clump and clot.

435
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,407
Hey, we don't have time
for a lecture on hematology.

436
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,106
I'll cover all the bases, give her
FFP, give her platelets in the O.R.

437
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,546
Not gonna help if it's
von Willebrand disease.

438
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,821
- Lacking the factor for platelet adhesion.
- You're doing bleeding time?

439
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,457
Yeah, I've seen a lot of
coagulopathy in the ICU.

440
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,221
Over 10 minutes, we have the diagnosis,
we can treat her without surgery.

441
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,797
- That's all it takes, 10 minutes.
- Pressure's up after the second unit.

442
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:10,266
- Okay, hang another two.
- You got 10 minutes, Gates.

443
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,230
Please, just kill me.

444
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,641
Don't worry. If
our guys die, I will.

445
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,640
- He's threatening me.
- I didn't hear anything.

446
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,907
- Hold still. I can't find the pulse.
- Officer, please move back.

447
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,414
I'm not moving anywhere.

448
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,347
- Benny, give them some room.
- Shut up.

449
00:21:26,552 --> 00:21:28,612
This guy needs two of
Ativan and five of MS.

450
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,314
How do you think our guys feel...?
- Stop it.

451
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,869
Think if you die, they
gonna fill the hall?

452
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,454
Move back.

453
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,461
- Please get him out of here.
- You're making my job harder.

454
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,156
- Not gonna ask you again.
- You jack somebody for $10?

455
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,864
- Want me to call Vascular?
- And Radiology.

456
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,299
- You're just a scumbag!
- All right, look.

457
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,133
Hey, Benny, back down.

458
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,275
Come on, man.

459
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,808
That's enough. GRADY: Stop.

460
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,878
Let go of me. - Sir, stop.

461
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,074
Hey, hey.

462
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,819
All she had was 10!

463
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:16,229
Oh... Oh, okay, okay.

464
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,531
Are you hungry?

465
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,876
It's... Lookit. Mmm.
Yum-yum-yum. Mmm.

466
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:28,537
Joe, come on.

467
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,909
Please, please, please, come on.

468
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,052
Okay, all right. Okay,
we'll put it away.

469
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,848
We'll put it away.
We won't have it.

470
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,650
Oh.

471
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,361
Lovely.

472
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,736
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

473
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,929
There you go.

474
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,904
No.

475
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,680
Okay, okay, one
second, one second.

476
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,849
Should we fold this?
Should we fold this?

477
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:07,043
Look, this dirty, dirty nappy.

478
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,585
Ohh.

479
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,383
O.R.'s ready.

480
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,287
Let's go, it's been
over 15 minutes.

481
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,587
Hold on, the DDAVP will
increase the von Willebrand factor.

482
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,924
- The bleeding will stop, trust me.
- Time's up.

483
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,590
- Let's move her out, Lucien.
- Give me a few minutes.

484
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,635
- Give it up already.
- Look at the abdominal wound, see that?

485
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,362
Look, stopped bleeding.

486
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,439
We have hemostasis.
Same with the liver.

487
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,805
- We've given her the ability to clot.
- So she doesn't need surgery?

488
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,208
No, probably not.

489
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,776
We'll admit and monitor
closely. Good pickup, Dr. Gates.

490
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,078
Well, someone tell Moretti.
Maybe he'll let me back down here.

491
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,017
It wasn't that good.

492
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,959
- How's my daughter?
- Out of the woods.

493
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,962
- You can go in now.
- Thank you.

494
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,101
Thank you. ABBY: Mm-hm.

495
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,098
Very smooth, Gates.

496
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,933
Yeah, I've learned a
thing or two upstairs.

497
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,166
No point tenderness
around the orbit.

498
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,675
Ice it three times a day.

499
00:24:06,345 --> 00:24:08,246
How did you get that?

500
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,478
By being bold.

501
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,911
I was bold.

502
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,284
I'd dial back on the boldness
if I were you. Excuse me.

503
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,134
- Hey.
- Hey.

504
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,601
Well, your GSW is in Room 3.
They've been prepping his groin now.

505
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,830
Thank you.

506
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,941
So how'd it go in here?

507
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,100
Pseudocyst is drained.
His pressure is up.

508
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,143
And as promised,
no complications.

509
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,611
- Nice.
- I told you it would work.

510
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,842
- Hey, Finn, how you feeling, man?
- He's still a little snowed.

511
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,548
His repeat calcium
is up. That's good.

512
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:51,850
How does a kid get pancreatitis?

513
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:55,188
Who knows? But he'll do a
lot better after the anesthesia.

514
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,097
Look at this.

515
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,535
Second chest tube is in, 0 silk.

516
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,301
BP is still 40. ABBY: Bag him.

517
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:14,174
- No more bleeding from the chest.
- Nothing left to drain.

518
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,577
I need ultrasound. Check
his pericardium again.

519
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,911
I thought he was stable.
We were just talking.

520
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,381
Sometimes this happens.

521
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,719
Blood in the pericardium.

522
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,413
With no diastolic filling.

523
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,490
Barely has a BP.

524
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,321
Pulse thready.

525
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,521
Come on, Tim.

526
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,431
- Uh, pericardiocentesis needle.
- A thoracotomy tray?

527
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,852
Wanna do that? ABBY: Yeah.

528
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,539
Not gonna get the clots with
needle. Prep fast and wide.

529
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,907
No, no, Grady, no.

530
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,342
Atropine now.

531
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,378
He's like a son.
I can't lose him.

532
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,412
Wait, he's got a
rhythm and a pulse.

533
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,922
- We can still try pericardiocentesis.
- Penetrating trauma, pre-arrest.

534
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:03,187
- Perfect indication for a thoracotomy.
- Lost his pulse.

535
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,854
- Come on.
- Okay.

536
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,859
Okay.

537
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,402
Come on, Morris, hurry up.

538
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,914
Abby, take it.

539
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,283
- What?
- Ahem. You do it.

540
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,068
Oh, it's all right, Joe. Auntie
Neela's here, come on.

541
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,439
Come on, Joe, I just don't bring
out my Hindi for anyone, you know.

542
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,943
Come on, who's at the stair?

543
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,844
Who's at the door?
Who's at the door?

544
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,780
Ah.

545
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,956
- Lucien, what are you doing here?
- Hi.

546
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,119
I brought you some wheatgrass
to help build your immune system.

547
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,855
I thought we might do yoga
for your post-op stiffness.

548
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,795
You have anything
for crying babies?

549
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,162
I don't know, do I? Here.

550
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,826
- Help yourself.
- Hi, little man.

551
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,801
- There you go.
- Here, little man.

552
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:24,967
Hey, hey, hey, you like planes?

553
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,137
Oh, how about a 747?

554
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,381
Where's my copilot?

555
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,842
There you go.

556
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,949
- It's okay, it's okay.
- This is Lucien.

557
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,218
Oh, Dr. Subrin, yeah,
thanks for calling me back.

558
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,691
I need a favor.

559
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:45,956
County has a 13-year-old
patient with Fazio-Londe syndrome.

560
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,659
Yeah, I know a Dr. Gates has
tried to contact you about the case.

561
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,861
- It's okay, Joe, it's okay.
- Great.

562
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,667
Units five and six are up.

563
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,172
- We have a pulse with CPR?
- Yeah, good carotid.

564
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,400
Hold compressions.

565
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,573
Looks like asystole now.

566
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,172
Please keep going.

567
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,305
Might be fine. V-fib.

568
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,712
- Internal paddles.
- Charging to 30.

569
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,917
Clear.

570
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,818
- Come on, Tim.
- No change.

571
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,019
- Another milligram of epi.
- He's had three.

572
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,188
- Then make it four.
- Archie.

573
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,994
- No, don't stop, don't stop.
- Start compressions again.

574
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,034
- Do you think we could...?
- Concentrate.

575
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,297
Epi's in.

576
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,166
Shock one more time.

577
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,500
- Again?
- One more time.

578
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,071
Clear.

579
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:38,014
- Asystole for sure.
- Come on, Tim.

580
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,877
Morris, I think we're done.

581
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,284
Continue compressions.
We repaired the wound.

582
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,518
- He just needs more volume.
- Heart is full.

583
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,061
- What about more pressors?
- Yes, good idea.

584
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,359
- Pressors should've worked by now.
- He might still respond to...

585
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,866
Morris, he's been
down too long. It's over.

586
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,334
- Please, no.
- No, move, move, move.

587
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,070
Morris, we're done.

588
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,443
Hey.

589
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,655
How you feeling?

590
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,917
Ready for wrestling practice.

591
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,323
I just need to check a few
things out first. Go, "ah."

592
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:57,861
Ahh.

593
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,166
All good?

594
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:08,298
Actually, no.

595
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,408
No, it's not.

596
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,438
You're bulimic.

597
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,670
What are you talking about?

598
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm talking about the
calluses on your fingers.

599
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,310
Your eroded tooth enamel.

600
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,683
Your vomiting caused
the pancreatitis.

601
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,760
You know, I had a buddy in high
school. He was a wrestler like you.

602
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,592
He had the same problem.

603
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,132
He was always
trying to make weight.

604
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,834
Your vomiting caused
an electrolyte imbalance...

605
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:41,167
that stopped your heart.

606
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,773
- That's nuts.
- You could have died.

607
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,172
I didn't.

608
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,976
Not this time.

609
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,548
Dude, it's all good, okay?

610
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,515
I have college scouts looking at me,
so there's some things I have to do.

611
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,013
Everyone that's
good has to sacrifice.

612
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,023
But this isn't a sacrifice.

613
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,422
This is a problem.

614
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,424
Nothing I can't handle.

615
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,330
You call this handling it?

616
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,698
You're never gonna get into
college if you keep this up.

617
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,670
Is that what you really want?

618
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,209
I wanna win.

619
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,443
All right, then we'll get
you some counseling.

620
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,514
We'll talk to your parents.

621
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:28,085
Because if you
stay along this path...

622
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,546
you're gonna lose.

623
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,355
Trust me.

624
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,226
Hi. Hey, good news.

625
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,028
You know the IGF-1
trial at Hopkins? He's in.

626
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,397
- When can we start?
- Soon, next week.

627
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,563
No. I'm not going.

628
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,699
Say thank you, Joshua.

629
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,778
For letting me be a guinea
pig on some unapproved drug?

630
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:58,040
Hey, you're a Cubs fan.
Come on, gotta be an optimist.

631
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,882
I'm a cautious optimist.

632
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,351
Look, honey.

633
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,255
You wanna go back
to school, don't you?

634
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,054
Finish your thesis?

635
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,061
Well, sometimes you have to
do things you don't wanna do...

636
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,995
so you get what
you want in the end.

637
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,003
Think they have
Wi-Fi in Baltimore?

638
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,205
I bet they do.

639
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,004
Fine.

640
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,972
Thank you.

641
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,208
Thank you, Tony.

642
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,276
Hello? This is about me.
- Heh-heh.

643
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,050
Well, this is gonna be
good. I promise, all right?

644
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,628
- Hey.
- Hey.

645
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,266
You talk to him?

646
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,992
Yeah, but I need to call Psych.

647
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,161
Look, about this morning...

648
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,435
You never struck me as
someone with self-esteem issues.

649
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,406
I'm not.

650
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:01,770
Oh, well, you think it's okay
for a man to get what he wants...

651
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,473
and you get nothing?

652
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:10,316
Look, you know, I've jumped
through a lot of hoops for you.

653
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:13,152
I've asked you out the way
you wanted me to ask you out.

654
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:15,419
I call you when you
want me to call you.

655
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,756
But I'm not a mind reader.

656
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,367
Now, if we're gonna do this, we're
gonna have to do this together.

657
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,537
- Next time, I will tell you if I don't.
- Well, that would help.

658
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,673
Hell, you speak up
about everything else.

659
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,569
Guess you're right.

660
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,270
So dinner tonight?

661
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:35,880
Sounds good.

662
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,380
Do you mean that
or are you just faking?

663
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,125
Oh... Heh.

664
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,595
Mmm. You believe me now?

665
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,051
Is there any family I can call?

666
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,658
No.

667
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,621
I'm all he's got.

668
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:31,226
He's gonna be here for a while,
then we're gonna have to move him.

669
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,729
But you can stay until we do.

670
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,408
What about the jerk who
did this? Is he gonna make it?

671
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,916
He's upstairs right now, but tomorrow
he'll be transferred to the jail ward.

672
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:53,248
You know, I see
kids die a lot...

673
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,855
way more than I should.

674
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,459
Just this year, we have had
more young people get shot...

675
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:03,032
than God knows when.

676
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:10,200
But he, after everything that
happened to him when he was a kid...

677
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,038
he was trying to help.

678
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,074
Do you think he died in pain?

679
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,678
No.

680
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,214
Good.

681
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,421
He'd been through enough.

682
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:44,402
Breathe in.

683
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:45,971
And out.

684
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,910
And in.

685
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,284
And out.

686
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,752
Wow, I do feel better. Ahem.

687
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,421
Yeah, there's so much
healing yoga can do.

688
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,329
Western medicine
isn't everything.

689
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,936
You know, when I get
better, I might take a class.

690
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,436
They have them in the
anesthesia conference room.

691
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:16,472
It's Mondays and Wednesdays.

692
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,303
Thanks.

693
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:23,815
Hey, Neela, about what
happened at the wedding...

694
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,679
- Oh, Lucien, we were both drunk.
- Listen, let me just finish.

695
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:35,885
I may have gotten my
fondness and respect for you...

696
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,893
confused with something else.

697
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:46,770
And I hope you can forgive
my inappropriateness.

698
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,030
Oh, my God.

699
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,969
- Did I do it again?
- Where's Joe?

700
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,406
He's walking.

701
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,376
- Abby will be so...
- Pissed off.

702
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,851
She missed it.

703
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,085
Hey.

704
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,255
- Hi.
- What are you doing out here?

705
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,899
I figured you'd be home,
we'd get something to eat.

706
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,898
- All right, what do you want?
- Chinese.

707
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,559
Chinese it is.

708
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,763
Can we go to the movies after?

709
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:25,035
No, after we have Chinese food,
I'm gonna take you back to Wisconsin.

710
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,003
What?

711
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,877
You changed your
mind, didn't you?

712
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,451
You don't want custody of me.

713
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,611
- Yes, I do.
- Come on.

714
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,354
Sarah, sometimes you have to
do things you don't wanna do...

715
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,188
so you can get what
you want in the end.

716
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:45,956
What's that mean?

717
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,689
I'm trying to make it so
we'd live together forever.

718
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,462
But if you keep running
away, that's not gonna happen.

719
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,831
You gotta work with me here.

720
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,878
I guess we should
probably call them.

721
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,249
I already did.

722
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,214
- Chinese?
- Yeah.

723
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:12,448
Let's go.

724
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,593
I'll race you, come on.

725
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,559
Grady, wait up.

726
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,471
Fifteen thousand die every day. He
was not supposed to be one of them.

727
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,733
It wasn't your fault.

728
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,639
- I should've been thinking tamponade.
- No, you shouldn't.

729
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:36,270
Trajectory was nowhere near the
heart. Scan showed a normal pericardium.

730
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:39,007
- I should've monitored him.
- We were monitoring him.

731
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,653
- I just wanna go home.
- No, you just need to relax.

732
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,448
And pay attention
to the details.

733
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,250
If the ER feels too
overwhelming, don't worry about it.

734
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,290
I wanna go out with you.

735
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,492
Ever since I mistook you for an
intern, I've been thinking about it.

736
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,761
How about dinner?

737
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,598
- A movie, a drink at Ike Ryan's?
- I'm married.

738
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,770
You're what?

739
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,504
It's a ring.

740
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,009
Husband, I'm married.

741
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,538
Oh, God, I am such a rube.

742
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,645
It's the details, Grady. It
could save somebody's life.

743
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,420
Maybe get you a date.

744
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,455
Go home.

745
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,651
Tim's getting full honors.

746
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,750
At least there's that.

747
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,895
What happened to you in there?

748
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,198
My dad died.

749
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,528
What?

750
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,697
Yeah.

751
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,370
I got the call this morning
before those cops came in.

752
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,674
Well, why didn't you say something?
We could've covered for you.

753
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,383
What was there to
say? My cousin called.

754
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:23,886
He said my dad was in the
hospital for a week and keeled over.

755
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,685
You didn't know he was sick?

756
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,889
You mean, does my family talk?

757
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,933
Did my dad say:

758
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,265
"Call my son, I want
him by my side"?

759
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,634
No, no.

760
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:46,111
That's not the way the
Morris family does things.

761
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:55,242
You know, everything I ever
did was to prove him wrong.

762
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,252
Everything.

763
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,151
He said he was wasting his
money on medical school...

764
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:05,593
because he thought
I'd never pass, but I did.

765
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:11,034
He said I'd never find a job at
a good hospital, and I did that.

766
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:14,597
I had this plan.

767
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:24,278
To pass the boards in a few
weeks, and go tell him and say:

768
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:26,645
"Look, I did it.

769
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,544
You big dummy,
I'm a specialist."

770
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,357
But it's too late.

771
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:38,189
Yeah.

772
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,929
He's still laughing at me.

773
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,634
Oh, Morris, I'm
sure he was proud.

774
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,141
I mean, maybe he just
didn't know how to say it.

775
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,641
No.

776
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,449
No, he's laughing.

777
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,178
I can still hear him.

778
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,221
He's laughing.
