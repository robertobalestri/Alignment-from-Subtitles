1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:05,900
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

2
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:09,339
And until further notice, the acting
chief of the ER will be Dr. Wexler.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,144
What?

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:16,013
- You'll get your shot.
- Really? Hm? How long do I have to wait?

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,885
Have you seen Skye? I
need to take a leave of

6
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,596
absence. I figured
she's the one to talk to.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,860
Someday you're gonna
meet the right girl, fall in love...

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,600
and your first time
is gonna be special.

9
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,116
- Ethan Mackiner. And you are?
- Sam Taggart.

10
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,819
- I'm feeling real invisible around here.
- Be proactive.

11
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,930
Show Anspaugh and the administration
you can make their lives easier.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,007
So we've got Bulls games to go to,
and deep-dish pizza to eat at Arnie's.

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,477
Hey, they've got some cool
band at the Climax Lounge too.

14
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,083
How about the hospital lounge?

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,817
I have to go to work today.

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,323
Oh, well, I can come with you.
And we can hit the streets after that.

17
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:03,692
Listen, Jaspreet, that sounds fun,
but I don't party when I'm working.

18
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:08,165
- But what about last night?
- Well, last night was an exception.

19
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,997
There's gonna be
plenty of those...

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,605
because while I'm here,
we're gonna be partying.

21
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:13,866
And how long is that?

22
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,408
Until my parents give up on the idea
of me marrying Chemmel Narayan.

23
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:22,077
- Who's that?
- Some creepy doctor Dad wants for me.

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,615
He's got a bigger muffin
top than Humpty Dumpty.

25
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,584
And every time I even
think about shagging him...

26
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,017
I throw up in my mouth.

27
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,624
Your dad wants you to have an
arranged marriage? I thought he was cool.

28
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,058
He's a bloody wanker.

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,060
He tries to act like
the family man...

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,259
but the truth is, he has some chick
half his age living in Notting Hill.

31
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:45,099
Jaspreet, your parents don't
know you're here, do they?

32
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:48,265
- I'm sure American Express will tell them.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,308
Okay, come on,
everybody. Keep it going.

34
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,412
We're almost
there. Keep it going.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,744
Come on, Sam. You're
doing good. Come on.

36
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,445
I was at mile five, but
this is a little too much.

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,647
You got to run on your toes.

38
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,621
You land on the
flat of your feet.

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,783
- Are you seeing stars yet?
- No.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,223
I'm seeing a bench.

41
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,829
A bench with a pillow.

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,123
Great job, everybody.

43
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,062
Same drill tomorrow at 5 a.m.

44
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,793
- Next week, we add the bicycle.
- No.

45
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,267
No on the bicycle.

46
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,263
This is triathlon training, Sam.

47
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,998
Bike, swim, run.

48
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,339
How about a shower, or drink,
nap? That's more my speed.

49
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,979
Sam, you okay?

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,615
No. I need a gurney.

51
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,342
I'll tell them to send one out for you.
- And some O2.

52
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,918
Tell them everything
you've ever implemented.

53
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,318
Document compliance,
medication reconciliation.

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,652
- Mention when I went to Africa?
- Of course.

55
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,125
- Tell them how good you are in bed too.
- I should've worn that suit.

56
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,924
- This one's fine.
- Are these pants wrinkly?

57
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,260
All right, I'm wigging
out. I don't know why.

58
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,164
You are gonna
rock this. I know it.

59
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,837
Pratt, can you give me a hand?

60
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,473
I've got a meeting with
Anspaugh. Get Skye.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,974
This is Beth Ackerman, 22. Fell
down the escalator at Bloomingdale's.

62
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,976
It was 50 percent
off suede boots.

63
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:02,207
- I'm Dr. Gates, are you in pain?
- Yeah, my ankle's killing me.

64
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,011
Deformity and point
tenderness over the distal tib-fib.

65
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,711
- She said her stomach hurts too.
- We'll take a look.

66
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,484
- She took a pretty good fall. BETH:
I didn't break that glass vase, did I?

67
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,524
Sam, you're running
a little late here.

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,390
I'll be ready in a minute.

69
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,393
- You okay?
- Oh, she's fine.

70
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,122
- Yeah?
- You're fine, right?

71
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,460
Shut up.

72
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,000
And the truth is, I'm not
some Ivy League import.

73
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,401
I trained here as a med
student and a resident.

74
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,870
I know that ER better
than any other candidate.

75
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,376
I've been nominated for a
med school teaching award.

76
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,079
I'm efficient.

77
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,580
And I understand the need to
balance teaching with productivity.

78
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,585
I'm the fastest attending on the
floor, and I have the records to prove it.

79
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,724
- What else would you want in a chief?
- Experience.

80
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,722
Come on, you've
hired experience.

81
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,361
And all you got out of it
was a mental breakdown...

82
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,157
and another guy who
didn't last three months.

83
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,560
I love your chutzpah.

84
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,935
I've told you this,
but I don't see it.

85
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,262
You don't see what?

86
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,867
Some people are
leaders, Dr. Pratt.

87
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,167
Some people aren't.

88
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,210
- Dr. Anspaugh, with...
- I have talked to your supervisors.

89
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,143
Yes, Kovac told you to
go to Africa, and you did it.

90
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,341
Kovac also told you what to
change in the ER. You did that too.

91
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,419
But, without prompting,
what have you done here?

92
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,782
In order to overlook
these candidates...

93
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,688
I would have to see that
you are an undeniable choice.

94
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:21,855
And I'm not convinced.

95
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,957
Maybe I shouldn't
be here at all.

96
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,634
- Dr. Pratt...
- No, I've been busting my butt.

97
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:31,533
If you don't see that, why
should I waste my time here?

98
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,731
So you're going to give
up if you don't get this?

99
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,274
No.

100
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,039
I'm gonna go somewhere I'm
respected. And my efforts aren't in vain.

101
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,116
Consider this my
two weeksâ€™ notice.

102
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,060
I think you're overreacting.

103
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,394
If they're so hung up on status
quo, why spend another day here?

104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,296
- This is your family.
- No, my Aunt Ellen's family.

105
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,800
This is business.

106
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,995
Look, Morris, I love
you guys. I really do.

107
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,232
- But this isn't right.
- What happened?

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,705
- Your people getting oppressed?
- Shut up, Frank.

109
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,505
They didn't say you'll never
get it. They said not now.

110
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,511
You think Anspaugh
will make you chief?

111
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,674
If I leave and jam at another
hospital, he'll change his mind.

112
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,717
- Then what? You'll come back?
- Hell, no.

113
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,821
- Fight the power.
- Shut up, Frank.

114
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,184
- Dr. Pratt, can you jump on this?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,223
Eight-year-old, head
lac, seems altered.

116
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,953
- And you are?
- Teacher's aide.

117
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,189
He fell in gym class.

118
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,990
- Did he pass out?
- I wasn't there.

119
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,564
They told me to bring him in.

120
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,667
Hey, I'm Dr. Pratt.
What's your name?

121
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,030
My head hurts.

122
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,399
We're gonna get you
checked out. Exam 3.

123
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:41,906
- What labs do you want?
- CBC for a baseline.

124
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,355
We were leaving the store.

125
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,002
She wanted me to take her
home, but she was in pain.

126
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,619
- Where do you live?
- In Harvey.

127
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,773
Jack got us a weekend special.

128
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,384
We saw <i>Jersey Boys</i> last night.
Capped it off with a couple martinis.

129
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,680
Six, to be exact.

130
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,517
Sounds like fun.
Special occasion?

131
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,556
Beth, can you take a
deep breath for me?

132
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,284
Yeah, she got back from a
tour in Iraq two weeks ago.

133
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,395
How long were you there?

134
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:06,492
Thirteen months.
Going back in six weeks.

135
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,892
- You military too?
- Marines.

136
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,403
After 9/11, they
sent me to Guam.

137
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,269
- What's happening in Guam?
- Not enough.

138
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,272
- Any allergies?
- Walnuts.

139
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,776
That's about it.

140
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,278
Okay, a little stick here.

141
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,879
Looking better than
the last time I saw you.

142
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,987
- I was a little winded.
- A little winded.

143
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,316
You were sucking
air like a dry guppy.

144
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,253
Ooh.

145
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,625
Oh, she has some tenderness
in the left lower quadrant.

146
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,924
Follow exams. Make
sure Trauma takes a look.

147
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,027
Okay.

148
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,595
I need you to go to Admit,
and fill out some paperwork.

149
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,830
No problem.

150
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,907
- Honey, I'll be right back, okay?
- I'm not going anywhere.

151
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,637
The icon's positive.

152
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,281
What does that mean?

153
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,642
You're pregnant.

154
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,186
One, two, supermodel.

155
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,321
Oh, that's fabulous.

156
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,189
Neela's like my hero.

157
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,990
She moved to America,
and she took it by the balls.

158
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,927
Yeah, she does have a way.

159
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,933
The rest of our family, they
have a stick up their bottoms.

160
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,504
But Neela said bollocks to tradition,
and she moved to the States.

161
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,938
- She's like our own Mick Jagger.
- I don't know.

162
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,339
More of a backup singer.
You know, like a Pip.

163
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,810
- I being Gladys, she being a Pip.
- Hi, sorry.

164
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:31,109
Radiology wanted me to stay
in CT with our diverticulitis guy.

165
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,550
We don't handhold here, Harold.
Let Radiology do their own job.

166
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,657
Harold, I'd like you to
meet my cousin, Jaspreet.

167
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:38,951
Hi, I'm...

168
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,888
- Harold, you're Harold.
- Right.

169
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,188
- Some people call me Jazz.
- I love jazz.

170
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,724
- Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie.
- Gillespie?

171
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,732
- Green Mill's the place for that.
- We should go sometime.

172
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:52,998
Really?

173
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,642
So you and me?

174
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,408
What's wrong with this guy?

175
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,080
He's having an asthma attack.

176
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,567
Somebody get an inhaler.

177
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,769
You're gonna feel a
little bit of a sting here.

178
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,013
Ow.

179
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,719
This is the numbing
shot for your stitches.

180
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,681
It hurts.

181
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,654
It will get easier after this.

182
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,725
Where do you think you'll go?

183
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,661
I'll call Northwestern.

184
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,822
They wanted me once.

185
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,059
Maybe they'll want me again.

186
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,228
You feel that?

187
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,230
Feel what?

188
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,933
Good. I'll start stitching
you up now, okay?

189
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,871
How many will I get?

190
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,742
About five.

191
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,747
Can you make it six? I want
one more than my friend Lucas.

192
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,219
All right, I'll see
what I can do.

193
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,017
CT's backed up. They said
to call back in a half hour.

194
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,216
This place needs
a second scanner.

195
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,760
Carlos, do you remember
how this happened?

196
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,921
I don't know. I was
playing kickball and fell.

197
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,026
Were you feeling sick today?

198
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,933
- No.
- Are you taking any medicine?

199
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,200
Epzicom, didanosine and Kaletra.

200
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,468
Those medicines are for HIV.

201
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,545
How long's your asthma?

202
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,376
I think it happened because
of my psychosexual stress.

203
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,778
Psychosexual what?

204
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,716
It's rare. They don't
teach it in med school.

205
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,216
- She's single?
- She ran away from marriage.

206
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,484
- Sweet.
- Harold, she's not for you.

207
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,251
She's a sex-crazed maniac.

208
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,730
Okay, come on.
Enough with the babying.

209
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,962
Neela and I have a rectal abscess,
and a woman versus escalator.

210
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:32,968
- Can I do the I and D?
- No.

211
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,971
No, Neela and I are
gonna cover the ER.

212
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,077
I got a lot of consults piling
up, and wanna keep the team.

213
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,146
- What should I do?
- You can deflate your little balloon.

214
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,478
And then take Bollywood
out there for a tour.

215
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,653
Okay. This is the uterus.

216
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,289
And there's the baby.

217
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,452
Are you sure?

218
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,823
Mm-hm. Look, there's
the heartbeat right there.

219
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,631
Hey, I called your sister and told
her everything's gonna be okay.

220
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,330
What's up? What are they doing?

221
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,135
An ultrasound.

222
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,829
Why? What's going on?

223
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,468
I'm pregnant.

224
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,172
You're what?

225
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,342
Oh, my God.

226
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,682
- Oh, we're pregnant.
- Yeah, pregnant.

227
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,688
Gonna be an adorable
baby. I can tell already.

228
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,450
What? Are these the arms right there?
- Yep.

229
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,561
And there's the
fingers and toes.

230
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,560
So it's about eight weeks old.

231
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,233
- Eight weeks? SKYE:
Mm-hm. At least.

232
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,062
The OB will do a
formal ultrasound.

233
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,533
Give you a more
accurate estimate.

234
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,640
Trauma's here.

235
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,678
This the escalator
fall, Beth Ackerman?

236
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,581
Yeah.

237
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,182
Hello. I'm Dr. Rasgotra
from Surgery.

238
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,686
Does anything hurt?

239
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,021
Sounds like he wants you to be
more proactive with your own ideas.

240
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,594
I'll take my ideas to
another hospital. Thank you.

241
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,888
I never liked Anspaugh.

242
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,658
Well, if you need help
looking, I can make some calls.

243
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,235
If I can't find a job fast enough,
I might need a sugar momma.

244
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,497
Oh, maybe we can
work something out.

245
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,437
- I can cook and clean. BETINA:
I'll take that into consideration.

246
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,440
Dawn, did Carlos
Moore's mom get in?

247
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,239
I left a message. Her phone
keeps going to voice mail.

248
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,882
Try it again. She needs
to know her kid is here.

249
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,883
Just because a boy steps to
me doesn't mean I'm gonna tell.

250
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,951
- That is not right.
- What would you do?

251
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,555
You gotta be up-front.

252
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,953
- Tell him what's up.
- Because he asked?

253
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,558
This is about being honest.

254
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,228
Damn, if that's the case...

255
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,921
I'll be telling people all
day that I'm HIV-positive.

256
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,891
The truth is, you're both right.

257
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,593
It is important to be honest.

258
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,896
But every guy you meet
doesn't need to know.

259
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,476
However, men you plan to be
intimate with do need to know.

260
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,611
Even if he just
wants to kiss you?

261
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,609
Jeanie, it's Carlos.

262
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,409
- What?
- They called. He's at County.

263
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,780
Ladies, I need
to cut this short.

264
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,986
- Is there anything we can do?
- No. Thanks. I left Sydney's prescription.

265
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,251
No problem. I got it.

266
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,360
We got a 52-year-old diabetic
with a non-healing ulcer on the foot.

267
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,797
- What's his glucose?
- Eighty-nine.

268
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,735
- Excuse me, is triage still in here?
- Yeah, check in at the desk.

269
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,469
My kid was brought
in about an hour ago.

270
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,874
- You have to sign in.
- His name's Carlos Moore.

271
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,844
- I need to know what room.
- I'll be with you in a minute.

272
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,210
This guy needs a
foot series and a CBC.

273
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:33,353
Please, just look it up for me.

274
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,550
Hey. Hey, get back here.
- I told her to wait.

275
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,249
What room is Carlos Moore in?

276
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,984
- Carlos Moore.
- Ma'am, you need to sign in.

277
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,561
- Jeanie?
- Hey, Chuny.

278
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,358
- What are you doing here?
- It's Carlos. He fell.

279
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,660
- You know her?
- Yeah, she used to work here.

280
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,326
- How are you?
- I'm good.

281
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,698
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

282
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,703
Exam 3. He's Dr. Pratt's case.

283
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,866
Come on, I'll show you.
The ER has changed a bit.

284
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,205
- How have you been?
- Good. You look the same.

285
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,848
- Oh, you look great too.
- Hey, there you are.

286
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:04,177
Hey. Are you okay?

287
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,415
Were you spacing
out during kickball?

288
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,780
I guess. It's so boring.

289
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,253
Yeah, I know. It
doesn't look too bad.

290
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,084
Jeanie Boulet.
She's Carlos' mom.

291
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,385
She was a PA on staff.

292
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,720
Oh, good. I'm Dr. Pratt.

293
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,726
We're about to take
him up to get a CT.

294
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,421
Really? He needs a CT?

295
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:20,396
Possible loss of consciousness.

296
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,228
Possible? Doesn't
the school know?

297
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,134
The aide wasn't sure, and I wanna
play it safe and get the scan anyway.

298
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,765
- Is Dr. Weaver here? I know her.
- No. She doesn't work here anymore.

299
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,468
Carlos is a bit more
complicated than other kids.

300
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,375
I know. He told
me about the HIV.

301
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,415
No offense, but I'd feel better with the
most senior person taking care of him.

302
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,487
He hit his head. And I have a lot of
experience managing head trauma.

303
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,317
I'm not trying to
be disrespectful.

304
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,324
But would it be possible for
me to speak to your attending?

305
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,986
Ma'am, I am the attending.

306
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,390
- Hemoglobin's stable.
- I'm not getting anything here.

307
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,900
Your fractured bones
are blocking the blood flow.

308
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,006
I'm gonna need to realign them.
- Oh, whatever.

309
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,265
I just don't get it.

310
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,672
Jack, we'll talk about
this when it's over. I...

311
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,003
Propofol's kicking in.

312
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,222
Good sats. CRENSHAW:
Let's stabilize posteriorly.

313
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,444
Okay, ready. On three.

314
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,780
One, two, three.

315
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,453
Whoa, whoa, what's
going on, Dr. Rasgotra?

316
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,091
Displaced tib-fib.

317
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:22,111
I don't recall having
orthopedic training.

318
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:22,854
Well, no.

319
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,364
Typically, the ER waits for the Ortho
team before reducing unstable fractures.

320
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,093
- Had no choice.
- We lost the dorsalis pulse.

321
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,933
- And now it's back. Really?

322
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,006
Oh. You must have
some set of hands, girl.

323
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,740
Call us when you've got film.

324
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,145
Go. We got a femur in 2.

325
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,686
- I really would prefer an MRI.
- A CT will give us the information.

326
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,484
Maybe, but it involves
radiation. He doesn't need that.

327
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,025
An MRI takes longer, and not as
good for finding a traumatic bleed.

328
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,360
It's gonna be okay.

329
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,691
I know, honey.

330
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:00,390
I just wanna do the right thing.

331
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,364
This is the right thing.

332
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,839
We can do the CT quickly
and without sedation.

333
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,202
And if you wanna stay, you have
to wear one of these lead aprons.

334
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,344
If not, you can wait
in the Control Room.

335
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,242
I'm not going anywhere.

336
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,178
This isn't gonna hurt, honey.

337
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,840
I know.

338
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:21,479
You ready, Carlos?

339
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,360
I'll be right here.

340
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,056
It will be over
before you know it.

341
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,072
That reduction was impressive.

342
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,403
Let's not congratulate
ourselves until we see the film.

343
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,068
Is it over?

344
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,008
Your bones are in place.
Need to wrap and repeat x-ray.

345
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,547
How do you feel?

346
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,249
I'm okay.

347
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,615
Who is he?

348
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,826
It's not what you think.

349
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,694
Was he someone in your squad?

350
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:04,922
Was he an officer?

351
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,434
Was it a journalist? The
guy you wrote me about?

352
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,467
- Now's really not the time.
- No, Jack.

353
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,573
Explain to me how you've been home
two weeks and are two months pregnant.

354
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,913
Because I was raped.

355
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,721
Kyle...

356
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,557
Kyle Petterson raped me.

357
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,801
Your sergeant?

358
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,635
You were laughing with
him when you got off.

359
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,574
- I saw you.
- He did it, Jack.

360
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,148
- You're lying.
- It's true.

361
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,907
- Stay still.
- You're covering someone you screwed.

362
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,452
- Why don't you go outside, calm down.
- Hey, get off of me.

363
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,747
Jack.

364
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,795
- God.
- I'd wait a year or so.

365
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,297
- Jobs are tight.
- No, the housing market's tight.

366
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,799
People always need doctors.

367
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,961
Hey, I'd pimp my dog
if it will get you to stay.

368
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,336
Why don't you pimp a few charts,
and clear the board? We're packed.

369
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,376
- You should put Abby back.
- She's taking some personal time.

370
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,877
Still? It's been weeks now.

371
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,309
So what? She'll come back.

372
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,542
I saw your nephrotic syndrome
patient. Consult's on the chart.

373
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,878
Thank you, Dr. Daniels.

374
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,782
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

375
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,946
- How'd he do?
- He handled it like a champ.

376
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,785
Oh, good. I'll find you as
soon as I get the results.

377
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,325
Okay.

378
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,187
Michael Grant from Northwestern.

379
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,060
- Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, you called already?

380
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,359
You snooze, you lose.

381
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,695
Hello? GRANT: <i>Dr. Pratt?</i>

382
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,132
- Yeah.
- I'll take the neck.

383
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,897
You talk some sense into him.

384
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,201
Oh, and this is the desk. It's
kind of like the epicenter where...

385
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,743
Where senior attendings
like myself create the action.

386
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,244
More like the chaos.

387
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,881
- Hi.
- Hi.

388
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:04,950
I'm Jaspreet, Neela's cousin.

389
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,019
Oh, I'm Archie
Morris, Neela's friend.

390
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,089
Not to be confused with boyfriend,
because we've never dated.

391
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,816
Why wouldn't I know?

392
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,257
Okay, Dr. Morris, Jaspreet
and I need to finish the tour.

393
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,555
Oh, tour? Tour?

394
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,528
Where has young Henry taken you?

395
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,894
- It's Harold.
- Whatever.

396
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,093
We went to the O.R., and
saw this guy carrying a heart.

397
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,363
It was so cool.

398
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:29,373
Then we saw this awesome MRI scan,
and saw pictures of this chick's brain.

399
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,704
We went to the morgue,
and saw this dead body.

400
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,346
And this thing was
dead, as in dead, dead.

401
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,281
Wow. Did he take you to the trauma
room where senior attendings save lives?

402
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,578
No. But I'd love to see that.

403
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,086
Would you? My pleasure.

404
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,088
- Wait, wait.
- Excuse me.

405
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,695
But I haven't even taken
you to the pathology lab yet.

406
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:56,602
We must have been asleep
about two hours when he came in.

407
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,704
First, I thought we
were being attacked.

408
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,643
That's why he was there.

409
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:11,445
But then he got on top of me,
and put his hand over my mouth...

410
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,553
and told me to be
quiet, and I froze.

411
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,249
Did you tell anyone?

412
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:21,258
The next day, we were out
on patrol looking for insurgents.

413
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,952
What was I supposed to do?

414
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,655
I needed those guys
to have my back.

415
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,232
- Still, he should be punished.
- It's too late.

416
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,270
I pretended it didn't happen.

417
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,463
Like Jack said, I was
laughing with him.

418
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,266
It doesn't matter.

419
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,574
I've been through it.

420
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:44,606
Holding it in gives you nothing
but nightmares and panic attacks.

421
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,184
I heard Jeanie Boulet
was in the house.

422
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,759
Oh, hi.

423
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,690
Oh, my, look at
you. You look great.

424
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,955
Oh, you do too.

425
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,258
Alex, do you remember Carlos?

426
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,459
You were this small when we met.

427
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,536
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

428
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,297
I got a CT.

429
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,136
About 45 minutes ago. I wonder
if they've processed the films yet.

430
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,141
- Who was helping you?
- Dr. Pratt.

431
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,008
Let's go find out if the
radiologist has them.

432
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,809
Okay. I'll go with you.

433
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,644
You all right?

434
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,321
Back in a few minutes.

435
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,792
So, what's going on? Are you
still running the same clinic?

436
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,827
One on the South
side, one on the North.

437
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,056
How's Reggie? Did he
finally make detective?

438
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,666
Yeah. He sure did.

439
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,530
We separated two years ago.

440
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,034
Oh, don't tell me that.

441
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,866
He just... It was
too much for him.

442
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,166
I'm at the clinic 24/7.

443
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,673
- Oh, so you're still close?
- Joint custody.

444
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,334
It's good for all of us.

445
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,970
- Have you heard from Doug and Carol?
- Oh, they are still loving Seattle.

446
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:50,912
Dr. Ross sent a
picture of the twins.

447
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:55,020
- They just started third grade.
- Wow. I keep saying I'm gonna visit.

448
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,349
And how's Carter?
Is he still in Africa?

449
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,322
I heard he might be coming
home for a visit in the spring.

450
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,190
I should have everybody
over for gumbo and Ã©touffÃ©e.

451
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,922
Do that. We'll get together
like the good old days.

452
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:08,033
Has anyone seen Dr. Pratt?

453
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,431
He's at the Jumbo
Mart having coffee.

454
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,902
I was just hoping I could get my
son's CT results, and get him home.

455
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,507
I'll give them a call.

456
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,939
Name's Carlos Moore.

457
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,609
Line's busy. They've
been slow all day.

458
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,551
- I'll go upstairs, see what's taking them.
- Thanks a lot.

459
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,874
I started making up
the schedule myself.

460
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,050
Before I knew it, I was
arranging teaching conferences...

461
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,786
reorganizing the
appointment grid.

462
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,726
Yeah, well, that's just great.

463
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,130
But Anspaugh doesn't believe
in me. You heard it yourself.

464
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,237
It's not about
Anspaugh. It's about you.

465
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,308
Make it so they
can't deny you this.

466
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,376
Look, there are some
Physician Leadership Programs...

467
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,707
over at U of C, coming
up in about a month.

468
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,212
They might give some ideas.

469
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,749
Why would I have to jump
when Northwestern said...

470
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,581
they'd die to have
someone like me?

471
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,087
You think you're gonna
walk in and run the place?

472
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,193
The head of the department is looking
for someone to mentor to replace him.

473
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,186
He wants to meet tomorrow.

474
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:16,836
You know, Dr. Pratt, when a fighter
gets knocked down in the first round...

475
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,630
he doesn't throw in the towel.

476
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,933
I'm not throwing in the towel.
I'm getting into another ring.

477
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,468
Excuse me.

478
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,112
Dr. Pratt.

479
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,771
Yeah.

480
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,979
Why is she up there?

481
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,711
No.

482
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,118
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

483
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,588
I gotta take care of this.

484
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,091
Dr. Pratt, think
about what I said.

485
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:46,221
Having you run this department,
that would be phenomenal.

486
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,372
- Have you seen our soldier's boyfriend?
- Who body slammed me?

487
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,942
- I'm not gonna send a search party.
- Yeah, you need to toughen up.

488
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,705
- You should come running with us.
- I lift weights, Sam.

489
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,143
I'm not into torture.

490
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:04,010
So why are you doing all this?

491
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,152
I don't know. I'm trying to
get out there a little bit more.

492
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,049
I'm taking wine tasting too.

493
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:12,186
- What's funny?
- Oh, I don't know.

494
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,487
I was just remembering
a dream I had last night.

495
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,260
Sam was in it.

496
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,994
I was? What was I doing?

497
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,658
- Hey, Sam, have you seen Dr. Wexler?
- Not in a while.

498
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,702
Hey, what was I doing, Gates?

499
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,863
Hey, hey, are those my films?

500
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,541
Yeah. I went to light a fire.

501
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,472
Yeah, you should've
paged me first.

502
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,136
- I was trying to help.
- That wasn't the way to do it.

503
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,179
- Ms. Boulet?
- Dr. Pratt, we should talk.

504
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,976
- Yeah, later.
- But, Dr. Pratt.

505
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,709
What is it?

506
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,016
Mind if we go talk in
the doctor's lounge?

507
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,424
No, I've waited long enough.
Just give me the results.

508
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,490
There's a lesion by the
frontal horn of the left ventricle.

509
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,102
From the fall?

510
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,863
It's contrast enhancing
with surrounding edema.

511
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,935
No, it's not from
the head injury.

512
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,902
Then, what is it?

513
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,547
Could be a few possibilities.

514
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:15,518
It could be toxoplasmosis,
CNS lymphoma, histoplasmosis.

515
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,627
Meaning AIDS.

516
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,327
My son has AIDS.

517
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,606
I never would've told her like
that had you not gone up there.

518
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,367
- You're blaming this on me?
- You went behind my back.

519
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,944
You're acting like I slept with your
girlfriend. I was helping you out.

520
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,204
I don't need it.

521
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,281
Had I gotten the results myself, I
would have pulled her into a room.

522
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,578
Or if you had taken a
second to talk to me...

523
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,416
Because of you, what should have been
a private conversation happened here.

524
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,354
You know what,
Dr. Pratt? You don't get it.

525
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,154
What don't I get? A
micromanager in complete denial?

526
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,196
This should be a team. Shouldn't
be working autonomously.

527
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:02,197
Please, give me a break,
okay? I came up on this team.

528
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:05,361
Now, the next time you're bored
and you need something to do...

529
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,631
try treating a patient.

530
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,468
Your own.

531
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,802
Chief.

532
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,582
He'd done so well for so long.

533
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,116
Then, over the last year,
his CD4 counts dropped.

534
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:25,724
They changed his antiretrovirals twice,
because the virus became resistant.

535
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,220
Let's just see what the
doctors have planned.

536
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,158
There are all types of
new treatments now.

537
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,798
Haleh's right.

538
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,400
Even if it means
Carlos has AIDS...

539
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:37,763
survival has improved
over the last decade.

540
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,734
Please don't lecture me.

541
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:44,967
I'm HIV-positive.
I know all about it.

542
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,907
But it's different when it's
your own kid. I know that.

543
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:57,855
It's so surreal happening here.

544
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,653
It's where I met Carlos.

545
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,525
Where I decided to adopt him.

546
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:09,332
We don't know what
this brain lesion is.

547
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,665
If it's toxoplasmosis, it'll
get better with antibiotics.

548
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,272
And if it's a lymphoma?

549
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,274
- Then there's chemo.
- You know that doesn't work.

550
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,173
If it's a lymphoma,
he's got months.

551
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,813
Why don't we just
find out what it is first?

552
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,278
How will we do that?

553
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,615
There's no simple way.

554
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:33,258
The only way to know
for sure is to do a biopsy.

555
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,953
Cut into his brain?

556
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,190
The neurosurgeon can do it
stereotactically with a needle...

557
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,526
under CT guidance.

558
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,834
I don't know.

559
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,365
It's the best way.

560
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:54,678
Ms. Boulet, a Reggie
Moore is here to see you.

561
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:57,316
It's Carlos' father. I gotta go.

562
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,681
Hey. HAROLD: Bam, you're out.

563
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,851
- What are you doing?
- Playing four square.

564
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,723
I don't even know how you play.

565
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,229
- Hey. Oh, okay, all right.
- Let's keep it moving.

566
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,026
Go inside, guys. Game's over.

567
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,897
- Jerk.
- They're not patients.

568
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,529
You whip that thing one more
time, I'll be sewing up their head lacs.

569
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,433
Get in.

570
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,436
The box, get in.

571
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,307
Get in.

572
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,582
What is your problem?

573
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,222
Why are you so agitated?

574
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,050
Morris stole my girl.

575
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,122
Your girl?

576
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,555
Jaspreet?

577
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:48,359
Two guys have taken my women
in the past two months, I'm sick of it.

578
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,693
Across the way, we
have the Jumbo Mart.

579
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,362
Down the street is Ike's,
a very fine establishment.

580
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,805
And there's the el, which
can take you anywhere.

581
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,068
That's so cool.

582
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,872
Hey, Neela, Jaspreet and I
were gonna grab some drinks.

583
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,741
- You down?
- Well, actually, I was...

584
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,884
Yeah, we're in. Double dates.

585
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,050
Be there.

586
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,460
Harold, come on,
let's go. Come on.

587
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,659
How are we gonna tell him?

588
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,264
Let's just talk about the mass.

589
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,396
What about the AIDS? You
wanna tell him about that?

590
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,766
We should take it
just one step at a time.

591
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,908
- You wanna start lying to him now?
- It's not lying.

592
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,306
- With all due respect...
- I know what I'm doing.

593
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,571
You're the specialist.
You have the answers.

594
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,805
Think this is easy?

595
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,473
- Patients have the right to know.
- He's my kid.

596
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,846
He's mine too.

597
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,456
You don't think he reads the pamphlets?
You don't think he listens to your calls?

598
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,683
Carlos knows what an
AIDS-defining illness is.

599
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,660
Just give her a minute.

600
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,997
Yeah, she's stubborn.

601
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,606
It's either her way or no way.

602
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,014
Hey, Sam.

603
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:12,174
Did Ortho see the post reduction
film on the pregnant soldier?

604
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,786
- They signed off on it.
- Good.

605
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,520
Listen, I'm sorry to hear
about what you went through.

606
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,353
Oh, yeah. Well,
I appreciate that.

607
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:26,692
But I don't think it's appropriate to share
that personal stuff with the patients.

608
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,363
- Excuse me?
- They're dealing with their crisis.

609
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,503
They don't need
to listen to ours.

610
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,548
Hey.

611
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,249
Hey, doc.

612
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,155
I thought you split.

613
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,253
How's Beth?

614
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,057
How do you think?

615
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,997
I don't believe her.

616
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:06,364
- Well, you think she's telling the truth?
- Yeah, I do.

617
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,530
Doesn't matter what I think.

618
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,841
I was always afraid of
her stepping on an IED...

619
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,003
or getting killed by a sniper.

620
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,379
But something like this...

621
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,875
We shouldn't have to
worry about our guys.

622
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,544
We're all supposed to be
there defending our country.

623
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,418
You're right about that.
But start by defending her.

624
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,390
What kind of spot?

625
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:36,125
Well, we're not sure. It could
be caused by some germs.

626
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,065
Or it could be something else.

627
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,195
Can they take it out?

628
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,307
It's not that easy.

629
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,908
They have to do
some more tests first.

630
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:46,409
What kind of tests?

631
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,814
What we wanna do is
just take a little piece out...

632
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,074
and look at it
under a microscope.

633
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,014
You mean, I have a tumor?

634
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,783
Remember I told you?

635
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,323
God helps us through the
good times and the bad.

636
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,759
Well, we have to have faith.

637
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:12,102
He's gonna hold our
hands through this.

638
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,608
All of us together, buddy.

639
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,471
Carlos?

640
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,775
Hey, Carlos. Carlos?

641
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,578
- What's happening?
- Push 2 of lorazepam right now.

642
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,256
- Second two didn't touch him.
- He's maxed out on lorazepam.

643
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:33,051
- What next?
- Pentobarb.

644
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,454
- You wanna go straight to pentobarb?
- Yeah.

645
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,652
- Pulse is up to 165.
- Oh, God.

646
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,957
- Try Depakote.
- Nope, it takes too long.

647
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,693
Get Pede's neuro down here.
- Why?

648
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:46,196
He's got elevated ICP, and
failed first-line drugs. A no-brainer.

649
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,840
I'd like to get a consult
before you induce a coma.

650
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,306
- Coma? No, no way.
- We should avoid intubation.

651
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,809
Gonna need general
anesthesia for the biopsy.

652
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,674
Sat's dropping, 87.

653
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:58,544
All right, call respiratory.
Prep a 6-oh-ET tube.

654
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,982
- That's excessive.
- He needs an anticonvulsant.

655
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:03,314
Pentobarbital,
300 milligrams IV.

656
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,357
Haleh, now.

657
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,730
- All right, I'm in. Bag him up.
- What about an EEG?

658
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,304
They'll do it in O.R.
Pentobarb drip at 30 migs...

659
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,738
- Does he need steroids?
- I was ordering six of Decadron.

660
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,071
- What's that for?
- To reduce the swelling.

661
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:30,405
- You staying while he's in surgery?
- I'm not going anywhere.

662
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,107
- Well done, Greg. HALEH:
They're ready for him in O.R.

663
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,287
- Hey.
- What's up?

664
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,549
- Beth's boyfriend never made it back.
- Yeah, I saw him outside.

665
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,022
I tried to talk to him,
but I wasn't persuasive.

666
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,685
You, not persuasive? I
thought you're a sweet talker.

667
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:47,230
Well, I guess even this
situation was beyond me.

668
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,129
Guess again.

669
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,935
He came back.
Well, I knew he would.

670
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:59,134
I just wanna make sure that you
knew that I knew that, you know...

671
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,375
- How you doing?
- I'm better now.

672
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,482
- How's the ankle?
- The splint's really helping.

673
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,413
- Gotta keep it elevated, okay?
- Okay.

674
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,545
When can I get her out of here?
- Soon.

675
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,147
I just wanted to talk to you
about pregnancy options.

676
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,723
You know, I can make a
call to the gynecologist...

677
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,555
and you can have a D and
C done as early as tomorrow.

678
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,957
I'm not getting an abortion.

679
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,297
You wanna have this baby?

680
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,991
Beth, I don't understand.

681
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,966
Let me call a counselor
down here to talk to you.

682
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,740
I'm gonna keep it.

683
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,138
Pregnant soldiers
don't get sent back.

684
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,278
I love <i>Earth</i> and
<i>Veer-Zaara.</i> They're epic.

685
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,474
Since when did you
follow Bollywood movies?

686
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,448
Since he went on the
Internet 20 minutes ago.

687
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,948
Truth is, I don't really
watch Indian films.

688
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,092
When you go home to the
motherland, you've caught a few?

689
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,953
I've never actually
been to India.

690
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,622
Not every Indian
person has been to India.

691
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,666
Like assuming every
African-American has been to Africa.

692
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,804
Well, I mean, just assumed.
Arranged marriages, India. Hello?

693
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:01,940
- You assumed wrong, butt-head.
- Bite me.

694
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,006
Rasgotra. You buying?

695
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,768
Dr. Grossman.

696
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,412
I'll be right back.

697
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,943
I hope you're
cool about earlier.

698
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,983
What? About how
you stole our case?

699
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,711
I was trying to be proactive.

700
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,618
That's what my girlfriend
said when she moved out.

701
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,056
I'm joking, Rasgotra.
I love proactivity.

702
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,857
In fact, how would you
feel about an ortho rotation?

703
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,333
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

704
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,026
Well, I'm flattered.

705
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,137
- I'll have to talk to Dr. Dubenko first.
- I already did that.

706
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:37,241
You have a surgical-elective
requirement, so now you're all mine.

707
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,534
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

708
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,736
And he's gonna just
let me out that easily?

709
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:44,711
You're gonna be with the
cool kids next week. Be ready.

710
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,384
I'm pretty tough.

711
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,249
- Having the baby is not the answer.
- Beth, there are other ways.

712
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,320
I am not going back over there.

713
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,959
- I don't believe in it anymore.
- So report him.

714
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,355
I can't prove anything.

715
00:34:56,962 --> 00:35:00,160
What if he's hurting other
people too? Think about that.

716
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,091
Yeah, he's right.

717
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,667
I know it's scary,
but you can do it.

718
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,373
I love you. And I support you.

719
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:17,206
The last thing that I'm gonna do is
let anything else bad happen to you...

720
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,782
including going back over there.

721
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,718
I promise.

722
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,597
Okay.

723
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:57,245
- Yeah.
- What are you looking at?

724
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,220
You fools.

725
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:03,055
Neela's crazy cousin took these.

726
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:09,299
We are the most idiotic,
dysfunctional family ever.

727
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,268
If anybody's looking
for me, I'll be upstairs.

728
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:19,172
Yeah, okay.

729
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,056
Hey.

730
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,686
They're still working on him.

731
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,922
I was gonna go get some coffee.

732
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,194
You okay?

733
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,368
That's our boy.

734
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,608
I mean, she can sit
there and watch it. I can't.

735
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,971
I know it's tough seeing
your kid in there like that.

736
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:59,174
You would think her getting
HIV would've crippled her.

737
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,785
But she turned
it into a mission.

738
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,946
The clinics, the patients.

739
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,849
If she's not mentoring someone,
she's following up with a teenager...

740
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:11,587
making sure they're
taking their medicine.

741
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,022
She seems pretty committed.

742
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,462
Yeah.

743
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,796
Yeah, she sure is.

744
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,867
If you have any questions
or you need anything...

745
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,477
don't hesitate to page me.

746
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,849
Aren't you supposed to tell me
everything's gonna be all right?

747
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,019
Hang in there, my friend.

748
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,505
Ice is all you can do.

749
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,904
Are you sure you can't give
me some more tips over dinner?

750
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:01,142
What? I thought it was pretty
good when we're hanging out.

751
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:03,338
- It was, but...
- Oh, don't tell me.

752
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,039
- You hooked up with an elf?
- No.

753
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,014
I was kind of
bummed you didn't call.

754
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,677
I went home to D.C. Got
tied up with the family.

755
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:13,290
But, look, this weekend, we could
catch a movie, get some drinks.

756
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:15,921
Sounds good.

757
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,262
What happened to the cop? I
thought he was your new lover.

758
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,368
- We're dating, we're not married.
- So this is a modern thing.

759
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,870
- Juggle more than one guy?
- Men do it all the time.

760
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,771
- Wanna hear about my dream?
- Not particularly.

761
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,377
- Earlier, you were begging for it.
- I don't beg.

762
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,138
In my dream you did.

763
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,078
- Ew! Was it sexual?
- Ew. No, it wasn't.

764
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,945
You were begging
to do my laundry.

765
00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:41,211
Bye, Tony.

766
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,981
You washed one
load, eight times.

767
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,817
- You're insane.
- What do you think?

768
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,824
You think you're like a
clean freak or something?

769
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,833
The biopsy's going well.

770
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,070
They've localized the
lesion and are getting tissue.

771
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:10,806
His vitals are great.

772
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:13,918
He hasn't had any
more seizure activity.

773
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,812
Jeanie, that's good news.

774
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,015
It's just the beginning.

775
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:24,922
He'll fight. He's a tough kid.

776
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:32,763
When I tested
positive 12 years ago...

777
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,733
people were so freaked by it.

778
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,804
Some of the doctors didn't
think I should work here anymore.

779
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,644
The nurses had problems
with it too. Even my family.

780
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:54,057
I would go home for Christmas,
and I'd hear my aunts talking:

781
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,729
"Well, at least she
doesn't have AIDS, girl.

782
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,627
We'd have to sit her in
the other room to eat."

783
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,995
I don't want Carlos to go
through that. He doesn't deserve it.

784
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,066
You'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

785
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,875
You know what scares
me about all this?

786
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:21,748
What if everything I've been
fighting for is a bunch of bull?

787
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,047
It's not.

788
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:27,181
I tell my patients they won't
end up here, but they do.

789
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,197
My ex, Al, died two years ago.

790
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,833
He was 78 pounds.

791
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,302
He didn't even recognize me.

792
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,932
And my friend Paulette.

793
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,940
She's the first person I met.

794
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:49,239
- Ms. Boulet...
- If I lose him, I'm done with it.

795
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,349
Don't say that.

796
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,412
It's true. I won't
do it anymore.

797
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,952
You have to.

798
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,424
Do it for Carlos.

799
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,219
Do it for yourself.

800
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:05,920
But whatever you
decide, you keep doing it...

801
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,931
because you are
exactly what we need.

802
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,535
You're not so bad, Dr. Pratt.

803
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,739
I know.

804
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:31,213
It usually takes people a while,
but I eventually win them over.

805
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,733
I wanna say a prayer for him.

806
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,804
Say one for us both.

807
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,766
All right.

808
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,199
Dr. Daniels.

809
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,995
Yeah, it's Dr. Pratt.

810
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,706
I was thinking about
what you said earlier, and...

811
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,506
Yeah.

812
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,337
I'm gonna stick
around for round two.

813
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:28,977
Good.

814
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,048
I'll be right up.
