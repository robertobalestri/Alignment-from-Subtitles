1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,266
Previously on ER..

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,500
Someone's down!

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,800
We have to wait for the area
to be secured.

4
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:11,466
We should not be out here!

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,166
I thought you were supposed
to smooth things out

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,500
between the ER
and paramedics.

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:17,366
You're my new intern.
I just gave you an order.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,633
Peter, I wasn't aware that
Reese had a hearing problem.

9
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,133
What I do with my son
is my business.

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,266
And I'm not interested

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,166
in continuing as intern chief.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,433
My beard is stuck.

13
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,700
I wouldn't have asked
so many questions

14
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:30,066
if you had told me
what you were doing.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, I'm sorry
that you thought

16
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,766
it was your business to ask me.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,366
Carter?

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,566
'What are you doing here?'

19
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:43,333
♪ The taste of love is sweet ♪

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,266
♪ And hearts like ours meet ♪

21
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:55,300
♪ I fell for you
just like a child ♪

22
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,266
♪ And oh but the fire
went wild ♪

23
00:01:04,466 --> 00:01:05,500
Hey!

24
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,600
Morning, Carter!

25
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,666
‐ It's Grace Jones.
‐ Ah.

26
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,166
Hey, I didn't wake you up,
did I?

27
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,133
I mean, you're on at 7?

28
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,533
Uh...yeah

29
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:17,333
but no‐no problem.

30
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:20,133
'Good. You settling in
down there?'

31
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,100
Yes, I like it.

32
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:28,200
You have a very interesting
CD collection.

33
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,466
What?

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,000
I said you have a very eclectic
CD collect..

35
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:34,333
Thanks.

36
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,700
You know, anything you want to
listen to

37
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,466
just ask me, don't ever touch it
on your own, though.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,366
I mean, I‐I've rented
to a lot of students

39
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,566
so I had to make that a rule.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,466
Carter, let me make you
one of these, man.

41
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,733
Oh..

42
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,366
It will sling‐shot
you into your day.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,766
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,666
You're in a really good mood.

45
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,800
I am just...so glad

46
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,000
to be 100% focused on medicine.

47
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,800
‐ Hey, can I ask you something?
‐ Sure.

48
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,766
Do you find it easy to evaluate
other people's work?

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,733
Hmm, time to grade
your student, huh?

50
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,300
'Hm‐hm.'

51
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,166
I worry about being too harsh.

52
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,033
Does she deserve
to be judged harshly?

53
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,166
I want to be fair.

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,666
Lucy hasn't gotten
off to a great start

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,033
this year, clearly.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,033
But she's smart,
and she's willing to work hard.

57
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,700
So I think maybe
I should just go easy

58
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:28,666
and give her a chance
to turn things around.

59
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,233
Go on. Keep talking.

60
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,333
‐ 'One of the strippers?'
‐ 'Yeah, I'm saying, "Damn!"'

61
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,500
'Can't you cover that up?"'

62
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,766
She was destroying the magic.

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,766
I thought I'd come
for a ride‐along this morning.

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,466
Tell the truth, It's more fun
than the hospital, isn't it?

65
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,166
He likes it out there
on the front lines.

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,433
I mean, either that,
or we need closer supervision.

67
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,300
Somebody's got to keep
an eye on you, Morales.

68
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,500
Hey, doc, right here.

69
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,766
Oh, by the way,
can I crash here tonight?

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,500
My building's being fumigated.

71
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,733
You have to ask the captain.

72
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,433
It shouldn't be
a problem though.

73
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,600
You can sleep on one of the
Barcaloungers, I've done that.

74
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,433
Who paged me?

75
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,733
Huh, I got an 87‐year‐old man

76
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,700
with ascending cholangitis
for you.

77
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, well, I stopped
taking admits at 6:30.

78
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,600
Why didn't you page
today's on‐call team?

79
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,233
Ah, the guy came in while
you were still on call

80
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,366
and Dr. Romano
specifically asked for you.

81
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,633
How sick is he?

82
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,166
He's septic, intubated, ah..

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,733
‐ Hypotensive and in renal‐‐
‐ No, no, no!

84
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,200
This can't be happening.

85
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:32,800
Look, I haven't had
so much as a nap

86
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,033
in the last 24 hours.

87
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,366
Rounds are about to start.

88
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,266
I have to take a shower,
I smell bad

89
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,066
and you're giving me a patient
who's sick as a dog.

90
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,533
Look, what does that say?
What does that say? 6:38.

91
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,166
I'm not on call!

92
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,333
Eh, he's in curtain three.

93
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,100
Hey, we've all been there.

94
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,766
Shut up.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,600
‐ Tony Broadway?
‐ Yeah.

96
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,133
Is that
a great porn star name or what?

97
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,766
Hey, Carol, want to know
your porno star name?

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
What?

99
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,333
Take your middle name

100
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:56,633
and the name of the
street you live on.

101
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,433
Like mine would be
Anthony Broadway

102
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,466
Tony Broadway.

103
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,800
You got that mixed up, Jer.

104
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,200
That would be your
romance novelist name.

105
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,566
Excuse me.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,233
Your porno star name
would be your pet name

107
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,733
with your mother's maiden name.

108
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,666
Like my porno star name
would be Nibbles McGee.

109
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,333
Nibbles, that's a great
porno name.

110
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,533
So, then mine
would be Fluffy Florez.

111
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:15,033
What if you don't have a pet?

112
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,300
Just use one that you
had when you were a kid.

113
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,566
Nibbles. That is a great name.

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,633
I don't think
that's right, Jeanie.

115
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,233
So, Carol, what would yours be?

116
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:21,500
Oh, mine wouldn't work.

117
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:22,800
Hey, Jerry, have we
gotten a package

118
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,166
from Lakeside medical supply?

119
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,500
‐ This early?
‐ Yeah.

120
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,766
It's supposed to arrive
first overnight.

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,233
Tell me as soon as it gets here.

122
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:30,300
Kerry, have you got a minute?

123
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,333
We need to prepare these
attending schedules

124
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,466
and I'm not familiar with the
computer program down here.

125
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,366
EPSKED? It's a snap.

126
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
Jerry can take you through it.

127
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:40,366
You can't give me a hand?

128
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,700
Well, I got a lot of patients.

129
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,566
Dr. Anspaugh, got a woman
on five‐three

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,333
who's complaining
about her bill.

131
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,133
Says she was charged for
procedures that weren't done.

132
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,566
Why are you telling me?

133
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,766
Because those calls go to

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,333
the chief of emergency services.

135
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,200
Or the interim chief.

136
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,466
Tell her you'll pull her chart

137
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,400
review the bill and call her
within two days.

138
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
"...and I don't know how
I'm supposed to learn

139
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,400
"in this kind
of hostile environment.

140
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,700
"Our relationship has turned
completely adversarial

141
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,166
"and it's not good
for the patients."

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,533
Dr. Carter, we need to talk.

143
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Hey, Lucy, is everything
alright?

144
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,133
‐ Hmm?
‐ You were talking to yourself.

145
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,433
I mean not that that's a bad
thing, but‐‐

146
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,266
Actually...do you think
I should sit down

147
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
and talk to Dr. Carter?

148
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,500
Well, it depends on how
direct you want to be.

149
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,566
You don't want to be
confrontational from the get go.

150
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
You don't want him
to be defensive.

151
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,466
‐ Right.
‐ I would do it over a meal.

152
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,700
Oh, like a chat.

153
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,400
I like that, that makes sense.

154
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,766
'Oh, damn.'

155
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,233
'Um..'

156
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,766
‐ 'Hey, Lucy?'
‐ Hmm?

157
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
'Could you get me a tampon
from the thingy, please?'

158
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,266
Oh, I got one here.

159
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,333
'Damn it.'

160
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:44,466
‐ There you go.
‐ 'Thanks a lot.'

161
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,133
Peter, I'm sorry I'm late.

162
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,633
I was in the ER
with an admission

163
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,766
you need to see right away.

164
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,033
What's the problem?

165
00:06:50,066 --> 00:06:51,266
87‐year‐old‐male

166
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,633
septic with
ascending cholangitis.

167
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,333
He's on mezlo and flagyl.

168
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:56,333
I got his pressure up
with high dose dopamine.

169
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:57,633
Well, he's too sick
for open surgery.

170
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,433
We'll do a percutaneous
decompression.

171
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:00,633
I booked the OR already.

172
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,033
So, busy night, last night, huh?

173
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,766
Oh, God, horrible.

174
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,200
12 admissions, plus this one.

175
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,400
I got an abdominal
aortic aneurysm

176
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,800
stab wound to the chest

177
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,533
fall from a second‐story
balcony.

178
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,633
They just kept coming.

179
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,333
I used to work 36‐hour shifts
as an intern back in England

180
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,400
but this is making me realize
how long ago that was.

181
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,033
Alright, so I'll take him down
and we'll round at 8, okay?

182
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,433
Lovely.

183
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,233
Gives me enough
time for pre‐rounds

184
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,766
and, uh...a shower.

185
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh, you know, um, I bumped into
David Kotlowitz an hour ago.

186
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,133
He's a terrific ENT.

187
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,533
He's done a lot of work
with cochlear implants.

188
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,133
Did you tell him about Reese?

189
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,300
No, no. I just told him
I had a friend

190
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,100
in need of straight talk
on the subject.

191
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,066
Hey, Elizabeth, don't feel
the need to solicit

192
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,766
medical advice
on my behalf, alright?

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,266
I've worked with Kotlowitz
before.

194
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,400
That's the only reason
I brought it up.

195
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:52,433
If you'd rather I hadn't‐‐

196
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:53,600
Yeah, I'd rather you hadn't.

197
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,733
Fine. Forget about it.

198
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,233
What is that, a sternal saw?

199
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,500
Oh, yes, it is.

200
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,800
What is it doing down here?

201
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,800
My midline thoracotomy proposal

202
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:08,166
sailed through
the human subjects committee.

203
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,333
‐ Nobody told me.
‐ Yeah.

204
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:11,200
Well, I'm certified to use it.

205
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,633
So, we're up and running.

206
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,333
I thought we're gonna sit,
and talk this thing through

207
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,400
before it got underway.

208
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:17,333
Surgeons use it on odd days

209
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,566
ER docs get it on evens.

210
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Your turn's tomorrow!

211
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,200
‐ Hey
‐ Hey, bad news.

212
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,300
I was...hmm?

213
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,233
We're still not pregnant.

214
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:29,133
Umm, I guess we're going to have
to redouble our efforts.

215
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah, but they say if you do it
more than three times a week

216
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,566
we get diminishing returns.

217
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,066
You know, like re‐using
the same tea bag.

218
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,400
That's a romantic idea.

219
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,600
It wasn't very romantic, was it?

220
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,233
‐ Come here.
‐ Uh, Doug.

221
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:41,433
‐ Mm‐hm.
‐ Excuse me.

222
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:42,700
I've got a lethargic
four month old

223
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,600
hasn't been eating,
you better come see him.

224
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,733
Okay.

225
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,400
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

226
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,566
Okay.

227
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,466
The baby's name is "Sun."
Is he Korean?

228
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,433
Actually, it's Sun.
His mom's a little different.

229
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,433
Mm‐hm.

230
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:02,333
Alright, Mrs. Everly,
I'm Dr. Ross.

231
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:03,666
Can I take a look at Sun, here?

232
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,766
Please, I don't know
what went wrong.

233
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,133
He doesn't want to nurse.

234
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,200
Okay, we will figure it out.

235
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,300
Hey, you his big sister?

236
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,566
‐ What's your name?
‐ Sky.

237
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,433
‐ Hello, doctor.
‐ Well, hello, Sky.

238
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,733
Sun and Sky, huh?

239
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:18,133
She said he was fine until
a couple of days ago.

240
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,733
And then I noticed
she wasn't nursing so well.

241
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:23,266
Mm‐hm. Given him any solid foods
or formula?

242
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,766
Oh, no, only my milk.

243
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,133
My breasts are, like engorged
with him not eating.

244
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,733
When was the last time
he pooped?

245
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,266
Oh, man.

246
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,133
‐ When?
‐ Yesterday morning.

247
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,533
Mm‐hm, you sure?

248
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:40,066
Yes, I haven't changed
him since then.

249
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,366
'Okay, we're gonna hydrate him.'

250
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,666
'We'll give him 50ccs'

251
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,766
of D5 quarter normal saline.

252
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,366
'We're gonna have to do
some blood tests'

253
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,533
and I need your consent
to do a spinal tap.

254
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:50,766
You'd to stick
a needle into his spine?

255
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,466
‐ Won't that hurt?
‐ Not now.

256
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,233
We're gonna sedate him,
he is not gonna feel pain.

257
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,066
Ma, it's going to be okay.

258
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,333
Do you really think so, honey?

259
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,133
We'll be right back, okay?

260
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,500
Let's get a CBC, chem 20
and blood cultures.

261
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,800
Will you be able to
assist with the LP?

262
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,600
Yeah, sure but how are you
going to sedate him?

263
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,233
Propofol, I'm going to go
through pedes ICU and get it.

264
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:12,466
General anesthesia?

265
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,666
We've done that
before in the ER?

266
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,333
Um, there's a first
time for everything.

267
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,033
I'll take
the proper precautions.

268
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,766
'How could you?'

269
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,166
'You're not helping
with all of the yelling.'

270
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
'Oh, I don't care.'

271
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,366
'There's an ambulance
out front.'

272
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,633
‐ 'Don't open that door.'
‐ 'Get away from me!'

273
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,466
‐ 'Don't touch me.'
‐ Open up!

274
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,733
'Get away from me! Don't touch
me! Don't touch me! Don't‐‐'

275
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,266
‐ Yes, hello.
‐ We got a 911 call..

276
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,533
‐ Male with bleeding‐‐
‐ Yes, I called‐‐

277
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,666
This is a mistake,
she shouldn't have called.

278
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
Get in here, for God's sake!

279
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,433
‐ Where's the injured man?
‐ Here, he's in here.

280
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,366
This is not a medical emergency.

281
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,666
‐ Everything's fine.
‐ Where's he? Where'd he go?

282
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,400
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

283
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,466
‐ What is your name, sir?
‐ Richard Weingarten.

284
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,566
He let this lunatic drill
a hole in his head.

285
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,266
I'm an emergency physician,
why don't you let me

286
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,433
take a look at that?

287
00:10:48,466 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm alright.

288
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,200
Okay, just sit down here,
sit down.

289
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,766
What are you ashamed of? Oh!

290
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,366
‐ What happened here?
‐ Well, it's called trepanation.

291
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,433
It's a centuries‐old practice.

292
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,666
'It's a legitimate means'

293
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,533
'of increasing
brain‐blood volume.'

294
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,433
I had mine done
in Amsterdam, 1968.

295
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:05,633
Oh my God.

296
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,033
'It was like God lifted'

297
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,266
'a weight from my shoulders.'

298
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,166
This is a surgical drill.

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,666
We're going to the hospital.

300
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,166
You can't take me
against my will.

301
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,733
I've studied this for years.

302
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,633
I didn't embark on it lightly.

303
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,400
Let us at least
put a bandage on

304
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,033
and get a blood pressure.

305
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:24,766
Okay, sir, just sign this.

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,333
It says you refused treatment.

307
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,266
I want you go to the rig
and get some saline.

308
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,566
Come on, Rich, we did it.

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,566
‐ You did it‐‐
‐ The internet!

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,700
That's what started
this whole thing!

311
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,766
For God's sake, Laura.

312
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,400
Get her outside!

313
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,666
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?

314
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,733
‐ Outside, Now!
‐ Don't touch me!

315
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,166
Why don't you just calm down?

316
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,100
'I want to go back inside,
I want to go back inside.'

317
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:48,500
I can see that
you're an intelligent person.

318
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,700
'I don't wanna take you
anywhere against your will.'

319
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,400
I had to do something.

320
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:56,600
Alright, okay.

321
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,500
It doesn't look like
you penetrated the dura.

322
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:02,333
All I want to do is put
a sterile dressing on

323
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,100
to clean the wound, okay?

324
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,533
I'm going to leave you
some saline

325
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,366
and a supply of gauze
so that you

326
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,133
or your friend
can keep it clean.

327
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:12,100
I forgot to bring any gauze.

328
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,766
Hmm.

329
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,333
Yeah, I've held enough
screaming babies to know.

330
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,507
They have to be sedated.

331
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,740
Doug...what are you doing?

332
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,840
You can't administer propofol
to an infant.

333
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:26,173
Well, you've been doing it
upstairs for ten years.

334
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,840
You're not an anesthesiologist.

335
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,873
I didn't think you'd have
a problem with it, Alex.

336
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,373
Well...well, I do.

337
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,173
I have him on a cardiac monitor,
a pulse ox, dynamap

338
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,007
and I have a crash cart
standing by.

339
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,373
You can not just make up
policy as you go along.

340
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:43,140
I'm here trying to prevent pain.

341
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,440
Do what's best
for this little boy.

342
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:46,307
If you want to discuss policy

343
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,340
then leave,
and we'll do it later.

344
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,740
We will.

345
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:00,073
Dr. Carter, you want to grab
some lunch later?

346
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,307
Let's see how the day goes.

347
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,340
Can you tell me
about this patient

348
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,107
with dysuria in curtain three?

349
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,807
30 year old male with pain
on urination for three days.

350
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,740
The UA is negative
for white cells‐‐

351
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:10,240
Chlamydia.

352
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,840
‐ Did you do a sexual history?
‐ Yeah.

353
00:13:11,873 --> 00:13:13,207
He's only had two partners
in the last year

354
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
and he used condoms.

355
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,907
So he claims.

356
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,273
Send off a DNA probe
and treat empirically.

357
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,007
What's the treatment
for chlamydia?

358
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,273
Doxycycline BID or
a one time dose of zithromax.

359
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,807
Very good.

360
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,940
But I really think you should
look at his chart.

361
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:26,773
‐ Hi, I'm Dr. Carter.
‐ Hey.

362
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,240
I need to ask you,
do you always use condoms?

363
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:31,040
Uh, pretty much, yeah.

364
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,773
There's times recently
where you haven't?

365
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:36,473
Well, once or twice,
maybe, yeah.

366
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:37,907
That's all it takes.

367
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,473
We're going to give you
some antibiotics.

368
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:41,373
'cause I believe that you have
a very common infection

369
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,407
called chlamydia.

370
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,773
What, VD?

371
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,507
A sexually transmitted disease,
yes.

372
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,107
Wh‐whoa, she doesn't think so.

373
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,773
He also had conjunctivitis

374
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,240
and polyarticular arthralgias

375
00:13:52,273 --> 00:13:53,907
of the knee and ankle.

376
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,307
Mr. Bussey, would you
excuse us for a moment?

377
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,140
He was in Mexico three weeks ago
and had diarrhea

378
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,840
and the timing and symptoms are
classic for Reiter's syndrome.

379
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:07,140
You could've included that
in your presentation.

380
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,473
I tried to, but you cut me off.

381
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,273
All you had to say was,
"I think it's Reiter's."

382
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,973
You wouldn't let me get a word
in, you're always doing‐‐

383
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,340
I'm always doing what, Lucy?

384
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,973
Like right now,
you're getting defensive.

385
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:16,773
You don't even hear me.

386
00:14:19,773 --> 00:14:24,040
So, what's the treatment
for Reiter's syndrome?

387
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,873
Indomethacin.

388
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,273
But, we can still send
off a chlamydia probe.

389
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:30,007
No, you're right, it's Reiter's.

390
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,340
Good pick up, Lucy.

391
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,807
Propofol is ideal

392
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
ideal for use in the ER.

393
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:42,340
This is about how
policy is made.

394
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,807
And it wears off
within four...

395
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,207
Don't you think a doctor
should be trained..

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,907
We've got a gunshot wound
to the chest coming in.

397
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,840
The saw is sterilized
in trauma one.

398
00:14:50,873 --> 00:14:53,507
We need to be ready to go
in case this guy qualifies.

399
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,240
You'll be documenting
ten critical times.

400
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:56,507
The clock starts when?

401
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,140
Soon as the patient
enters the trauma room.

402
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,773
Don't they need to have a
cardiac arrest

403
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:00,807
to be in the study?

404
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,140
This guy sounded okay.

405
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,907
These patients
can deteriorate en route.

406
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,173
46‐year‐old man shot in the
right chest with a BB gun.

407
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,440
‐ Hemodynamically stable.
‐ The BB gun?

408
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:11,773
The punk who shot me
needs to be put under the jail

409
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:13,807
ten years old, or
no ten years old.

410
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,073
Let me up off of this.
I can walk.

411
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,307
Doctor, let him go.

412
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,007
Doesn't look like
he needs a thoracotomy.

413
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,407
Nope, he just needs a tetanus
shot and a Band‐Aid.

414
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,773
You can follow me, sir.

415
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:23,873
You want to turn right around

416
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,907
or can we hang for a little bit?

417
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,473
Nah, take ten minutes.

418
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,873
Hey, Carol, what's going on?

419
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,840
Um, just doing
a quick blood draw.

420
00:15:33,873 --> 00:15:36,173
Uh, so, how's the clinic
going today?

421
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,273
Oh, I just love prenatal days.

422
00:15:38,307 --> 00:15:40,473
Takes me back to my OB Roots.

423
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,840
Why don't you let
one of the nurses do that?

424
00:15:42,873 --> 00:15:44,740
'Cause I was trying
to be discreet.

425
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:48,040
Then let me do it. It's kind of
hard to stick yourself.

426
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,107
Thanks.

427
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,507
What kind of labs you need?

428
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,407
Just a, uh, a CBC.

429
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,207
Check if I'm anemic.

430
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,507
Oh. I only ask
because if you'd like

431
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,407
I can run the results
through the clinic.

432
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,907
Be more private.

433
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,273
That's a great idea.

434
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:06,507
Um..

435
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,440
...listen, what I'd really like
is to check my hormone levels.

436
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:10,773
Oh, okay.

437
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,273
Infertility work‐up?

438
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,307
I don't want to discuss
it in detail. No offense.

439
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,807
No, I wasn't trying
to get in your business.

440
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,140
It would be really great

441
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:18,340
if you could run it
through the clinic.

442
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:20,040
‐ Okay.
‐ Thanks.

443
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:31,240
Mark, I'm glad I caught you.

444
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,773
I've had to move things around
on my surgical schedule.

445
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:36,007
The interview with Dr. Lee
has been pushed to 1:30.

446
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,007
‐ Is that going to be a problem?
‐ No, it's fine.

447
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,473
‐ Have you looked at her CV?
‐ Yeah, it's pretty impressive.

448
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:41,940
If she's half
as impressive in the room

449
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:44,140
she just might be our
next chief.

450
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,007
And not a moment too soon.

451
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,907
Dr. Greene, I‐I didn't think

452
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,173
you were going to be around
till this afternoon.

453
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,240
I was on a, you know,
paramedic ride‐along.

454
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,507
We brought in a patient,
so, uh..

455
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,873
So, you, uh, finish your
student evaluation yet?

456
00:16:56,907 --> 00:17:00,073
I thought I had till
the end of my shift.

457
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,807
Uh, no big deal.
This afternoon's fine.

458
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,040
I mean, I wrote one.

459
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,140
I wrote an evaluation for Lucy

460
00:17:05,173 --> 00:17:06,240
but I tore it up

461
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:07,807
'cause I want to be fair.

462
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,340
When you're putting
something on paper

463
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,873
that's gonna impact
the rest of her life, you know.

464
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,240
Just evaluate her work.

465
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,473
Jerry, what are
you talking about?

466
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,840
I'm talking about
your porn star name.

467
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,307
You take your pet's name

468
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
and you put it together
with your mother's maiden name.

469
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,507
Try it.
Like, mine is Rex Voytek.

470
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,107
Oh, I know that game.

471
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,107
But it's your drag name,
not your porn name.

472
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,007
Drag name?

473
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,240
Yeah, it's the name of your pet
and the street you were born on.

474
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:34,807
Oh, I don't think so, dude.

475
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,307
Ru Paul had it on her show.

476
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,973
Yo, man, leave some crumbs
for the rest of us.

477
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,473
Who are you,
the cookie police?

478
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,240
You're welcome to have some,
but I brought those in

479
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,773
for the docs and the nurses.

480
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,007
So, then you're
the cookie fairy?

481
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,873
'Oh, now, wait a minute.'

482
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:49,740
It's bad enough you come
in here raidin' the icebox

483
00:17:49,773 --> 00:17:51,940
all the time, Now you want
to call names.

484
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,073
Connie, you begrudge us
a few bottles of juice?

485
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,740
It's not like you guys
ever bring anything in.

486
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,840
Hey, buddy, you should thank me
for every cookie I keep

487
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:01,340
from going down
your fat snack hole.

488
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,307
You just keep talking, Morales.

489
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,440
Hey, what's going on?

490
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:07,307
That one's got a problem.

491
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,807
You antagonizing my colleagues?

492
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,973
He called Yosh a fairy.

493
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,873
I called him the cookie fairy.

494
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,373
‐ 'It was a dumb joke.'
‐ A real dumb joke.

495
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,740
‐ Ready to head back?
‐ 'Yeah, let's go.'

496
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:24,073
I got no problem
him being a bone‐smoker.

497
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:26,340
I was just joking with him
like I would with anybody.

498
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,773
Don't worry about it.

499
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,007
Write the discharge orders

500
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,507
on Gardner and Wootton
as soon as possible.

501
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,407
Bed control likes to have them
by 12:00 noon.

502
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,307
Yes, doctor,
I am aware of that.

503
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,873
Hey, don't go there,
I told you I was going

504
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,740
to have a hard time seeing you
as my intern, right?

505
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:40,107
Huh, well, it's complicated
for a lot of reasons, isn't it?

506
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,140
Dr. Corday, Mr. Frybush's
creatine is much higher.

507
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:44,307
Thank you, Kass.

508
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,773
Should we call a renal consult?

509
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,240
Yeah, this guy needs dialysis.

510
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:49,007
So, did you ever
get that shower?

511
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,507
Uh, no.
Can you tell?

512
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,073
Well, go ahead. I'll cover SICU.

513
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:55,507
Peter, I don't want
special treatment.

514
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,873
You turning down a shower?

515
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,840
Look, I've got
a lot of work to do.

516
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,107
Okay, have it your way.
I've got to go find Weaver.

517
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,307
She's just itching to cut
somebody with that saw.

518
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,907
Going out to the roach coach
on my break.

519
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,007
‐ You want something?
‐ Yes, yes.

520
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,273
A triple espresso.
Thank you, Kit.

521
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,973
Elizabeth, how would
you like to scrub in

522
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:14,240
on a bilateral adrenalectomy?

523
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:18,240
Oh. I appreciate the offer,
but I'm post‐call.

524
00:19:18,273 --> 00:19:19,907
I've got to finish my work,
and quite frankly

525
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,440
I have to catch up
on an hour's sleep.

526
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:24,007
A case like this comes along
once in a blue moon.

527
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,207
I'm up to my neck in ER
Administrative garbage

528
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,307
but I'm not passing this up.

529
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,207
Well, it's been a while
since my last adrenalectomy.

530
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,873
It'll be fun. I'll do the right,
you do the left.

531
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,707
I can get Dr. Kennedy to cover
your service.

532
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,807
Jeanie, the Everly baby's
spinal tap

533
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,973
came back negative
for meningitis.

534
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:42,073
What do you think's going on?

535
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:43,107
Could be a lot of things.

536
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,373
We got to talk to the mom again.

537
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:46,207
Yeah. Maybe I could take
Sky out of the room.

538
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,907
She doesn't really need
to hear all of this.

539
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,307
Good idea.

540
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,040
Her mom leans on her a lot,
don't you think?

541
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,840
‐ Pretty smart kid, though.
‐ Yeah.

542
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:56,473
Okay. Hey.

543
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:57,873
What did you find out?

544
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:00,007
Well, the spinal tap
was negative

545
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,307
so I have to ask you
some more questions.

546
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,440
Maybe Jeanie and Sky
could take a little walk.

547
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:07,273
I don't want to be worried
about her wandering all over.

548
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,240
I'd rather stay here with mom.

549
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:11,473
Okay. Can she help me
put some toys away

550
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,907
while you and Dr. Ross talk?

551
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,407
'Good idea.'

552
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,873
‐ You mind helping me?
‐ I don't mind.

553
00:20:16,907 --> 00:20:18,373
I'll be right back, mom.

554
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:21,240
See what toys we can find, huh?

555
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:25,207
Okay, we need to see
if we can figure out

556
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,107
what the cause
of Sun's deterioration is.

557
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,173
Now, has he had a polio vaccine?

558
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,873
Oh, God, polio!

559
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:34,273
But he was vaccinated.
Is that 100% effective?

560
00:20:34,307 --> 00:20:36,273
Do you have a doll at home, sky?

561
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,007
‐ No.
‐ No, really?

562
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,973
I had one. Those are for babies.
I'm a big girl.

563
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,240
'I talked to
a pediatric neurologist.'

564
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:46,840
‐ And how old are you?
‐ Six.

565
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:47,907
Six.

566
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:55,007
After the adrenal vein

567
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,773
we'll work our way
around the medial

568
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,907
and inferior edges of the gland.

569
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,340
And, cut, please.

570
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,873
And another tie.

571
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:05,007
Elizabeth, cut.

572
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,140
Elizabeth?

573
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:12,040
Sorry. Yes.

574
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,907
You really do need a rest.

575
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,207
Why don't you step out?

576
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
No. I'm fine. I'm fine.

577
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:19,007
Go take a nap.

578
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,773
I'm sorry I dragged you along.

579
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,040
‐ Dr. Goodman?
‐ Mm‐hm.

580
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,273
Hey, Dr. Weaver,
can I run something by you?

581
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:35,873
Yeah, make it quick.

582
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,807
20‐year‐old man with aphasia
and right arm weakness.

583
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,040
CT scan was normal.

584
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:40,807
Spinal fluid is clear.

585
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,307
I'm thinking vasculitis or MS?

586
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,107
Interesting, send
off a sed rate

587
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,407
and a complement level
on the CSF.

588
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,973
Also, look at the differential.

589
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,040
There may be some zebras
you haven't considered.

590
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:54,007
Okay. Hey, Yosh,
is that Lucy's palmtop?

591
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,973
I love this little thing.
She let me borrow it.

592
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,040
Can I use it? When you're done.

593
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:00,307
I'm done.

594
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,973
Here you go.

595
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,773
‐ You know how to work it?
‐ Yeah, Lucy showed me once.

596
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:11,173
'I'd hoped to avoid this,
but things haven't improved.'

597
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,407
'And I don't know how
I'm supposed to learn'

598
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,040
'in this kind of
hostile environment.'

599
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,140
'Our relationship has turned
completely adversarial.'

600
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,407
Ouch.

601
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,873
'And it's not good
for the patients.'

602
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,407
'We need to talk.'

603
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,307
By the time we leave
the house, this crazy bastard

604
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,207
lets Dr. Greene
look inside the hole

605
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,273
in his head with a penlight.

606
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,307
Unbelievable.

607
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,007
I thought, I'd seen it all.

608
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,007
So, the doc writes him out
a scrip for antibiotics.

609
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,473
The guy thanks us for coming.

610
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:37,373
Yeah. I've got a way
with ranting lunatics.

611
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,207
I ain't kidding, man, you do.

612
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,873
Hey, what's up, guys? What's up?

613
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:43,107
‐ We're all here.
‐ You're not on today.

614
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,907
Truth is, they're here because
we got you a little something.

615
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:47,807
You like it?

616
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,307
That's great.

617
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,107
You're one of the gang now.

618
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,373
‐ Yeah...almost.
‐ Almost?

619
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,373
Well, there's something
every paramedic goes through

620
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:03,207
and we think it's only
appropriate that you do too.

621
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,040
How many patients
have you brought in

622
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:07,940
strapped to a backboard with
a c‐spine collar...thousands?

623
00:23:07,973 --> 00:23:09,473
Now, what do you
have in mind, guys?

624
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:11,940
Well, come over to the pool
table. We'll show you.

625
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,207
See, as a part of our training
we all get on the board

626
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,907
ourselves. You know,
to see how it feels.

627
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,340
So, you want me to
lie down on the board.

628
00:23:17,373 --> 00:23:19,007
Hey, don't worry about it.
We all did it.

629
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,307
Yeah, it comes with the coat.
This is good now.

630
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,873
Oh, and you gotta
drop your pants.

631
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,340
‐ No, no, no.
‐ No, he doesn't!

632
00:23:24,373 --> 00:23:27,440
Forget about that part, guys,
right. Just forget about it.

633
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,807
You know, I do have to, uh,
get back to the hospital.

634
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,407
Then don't fight.
All you got to do is lie down.

635
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,007
Relax, guys. Back off,
back off, man.

636
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,373
Let him do it on his own.

637
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:36,440
You want me to lie
down on the table?

638
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:39,107
‐ Yes.
‐ Thank you.

639
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,140
‐ Yeah.
‐ There you go.

640
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:41,473
‐ You okay?
‐ Perfect. Fine.

641
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:42,940
Get him!

642
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,207
‐ Hey, don't fight.
‐ Cut it out, guys.

643
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,873
‐ Get the shower!
‐ Come on, the shower's on!

644
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,240
'Stop it!'

645
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,273
‐ Stop it!
‐ Come on, take it easy, doc.

646
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,407
Hey, guys, guys, guys, come on.

647
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,007
Let him up.

648
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,740
‐ 'No.'
‐ Let him up.

649
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,407
We weren't going to hurt you.

650
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
'Much.'

651
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:08,807
It's all over for now.

652
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Hey, Jerry, know what
your name would be

653
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:19,273
if you was a porn star?

654
00:24:19,307 --> 00:24:20,740
Oh, that game is tired, man.

655
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:23,073
I got the best ever,
"Satan Monroe."

656
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:24,407
Your mother's
maiden name is Satan?

657
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,207
‐ Carol, I need you.
‐ What's wrong?

658
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,007
A 23‐year‐old woman complains

659
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,107
of severe right
lower quadrant pain.

660
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,440
Pregnancy test is positive.

661
00:24:32,473 --> 00:24:34,007
‐ A possible ectopic.
‐ What's her name?

662
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,307
Maria jones. Five pregnancies.

663
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,973
Two live births, two abortions.

664
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:39,307
'Hi, Maria.'

665
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,973
We're gonna take
care of you, okay?

666
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:42,973
‐ It hurts, it hurts.
‐ Alright.

667
00:24:43,007 --> 00:24:44,773
Oh, oh!

668
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:48,373
Let's get a CBC,
beta HCG, chem 20.

669
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:50,140
Oh!

670
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,473
Type and cross, two units
and start a line of saline.

671
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:53,773
Oh, oh.

672
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:55,107
Did you do a pelvic?

673
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,107
Couldn't do a good one.
She's in too much pain.

674
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,840
She said, I'm pregnant.

675
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,073
Is my baby okay?

676
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,273
Okay.

677
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:02,940
Oh, oh!

678
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:05,040
Let's do an ultrasound
while we're at it.

679
00:25:05,073 --> 00:25:07,040
Oh!

680
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,507
It just hurts so bad.

681
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,240
Okay, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.

682
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:15,273
Sorry I'm late.

683
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,807
We were just about
to start without you.

684
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,807
'Dr. Lee, Mark Greene.'

685
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,073
I'm sorry, if I held things up.

686
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:23,207
I'll try not to
take it personally.

687
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,773
'You've been very flexible'

688
00:25:24,807 --> 00:25:26,507
with your time today
and we appreciate it.

689
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,807
I'm happy to be here.

690
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,040
Let's get right to it.

691
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:32,507
Three years as associate chief.

692
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,073
'Excellence in
clinical teaching award'

693
00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,440
'two years in a row.'

694
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,473
How do you think you can
improve our department?

695
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,773
Well, right away you could
benefit from an eight‐bed

696
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,907
observation unit
for 23‐hours stays.

697
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,073
Paid for how? We're
a cash‐poor county hospital.

698
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:50,173
That's exactly why you need it.

699
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,740
'Tell us more.'

700
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,740
Well, I set up a unit
like that in Atlanta

701
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,507
and it saved the hospital
$2 million a year

702
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,807
'in unnecessary admissions.'

703
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,740
'What kind of patients
are we talking about?'

704
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,240
‐ Lucy, take this.
‐ What is it?

705
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,373
Your evaluation.

706
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,007
‐ It's blank.
‐ You fill it out

707
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,740
Since you think
I'm so adversarial.

708
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:12,240
Oh, and keep better
track of this

709
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:14,140
before someone
walks away with it.

710
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,373
Did you listen to
my private notes?

711
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,440
You're so sure
I was going to give

712
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:18,007
you a bad evaluation

713
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,440
you're already planning
me a countermove.

714
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:21,173
What's with that
"Hostile workplace"?

715
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,040
I didn't even know
it was time for my evaluation.

716
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,407
Oh, please.

717
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,773
Why'd you want to have
lunch with me today?

718
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:27,807
To get things out in the open.

719
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,873
Well, they're out in the open.

720
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:32,307
Now, why don't you fill that out
and let's see how fair‐minded

721
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,107
and objective you can be.

722
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:39,973
How long will my brother
and mom be upstairs?

723
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:41,773
Not much longer.

724
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:43,873
So what was the name
of the doll you used to have?

725
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,173
Baby.

726
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:46,907
Was Baby a boy or a girl?

727
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,740
She wasn't a boy or a girl

728
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,873
because she didn't have
a penis or a vagina.

729
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,040
What are you doing?

730
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,940
Letting him lick the spoon.

731
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:01,007
Do you ever let your
little brother lick the spoon?

732
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,173
Sometimes, with
things that he likes.

733
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,507
Like what, yogurt?

734
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,007
'Sun doesn't like yogurt.'

735
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
What does he like?

736
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:10,273
Lots of things.

737
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:12,740
Does he like honey?

738
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:14,040
Your little brother
licks honey off

739
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:15,407
of your spoon sometimes?

740
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,107
He likes it.

741
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,407
Okay.

742
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,907
Hey, Sky, let's go find your mom

743
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,407
and Dr. Ross, okay?

744
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,973
Okay.

745
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,807
'I really like
the observation unit idea.'

746
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,140
Good.

747
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:28,473
‐ A very good presentation.
‐ Thank you.

748
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:30,907
I'd be happy to give you an
official walking tour of the ER.

749
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,740
No, thanks, I don't
need to be hand‐held.

750
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:34,507
But I do wanna walk around
and get the lay of the place.

751
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,840
Feel free. I'll catch up
with you before you leave.

752
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,707
‐ It's a pleasure.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

753
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:42,207
Mark, do you like her?

754
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,373
‐ She's good.
‐ You didn't say much.

755
00:27:44,407 --> 00:27:46,207
I didn't think you
were very impressed.

756
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,340
I'd like to continue
this meeting

757
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:48,873
in a less formal setting.

758
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:50,807
I'm gonna see if Dr. Lee
is available for dinner.

759
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
‐ Would you be able to‐‐
‐ I can't tonight.

760
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,107
I'm‐I'm sorry.
Excuse me, Dr. Anspaugh.

761
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,040
‐ Are you feeling better?
‐ A little bit.

762
00:27:59,073 --> 00:28:01,240
Going to the bathroom
helped, huh?

763
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:03,040
Maybe it was just gas pains.

764
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:05,473
Well, you haven't had any
bleeding, which is good.

765
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:07,273
Hm‐mm, you're further along
than we thought.

766
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:09,873
Looks like 15 weeks.

767
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:12,207
I wasn't even totally sure
I was pregnant.

768
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,207
Look.

769
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:16,407
Can‐can you tell?

770
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,907
Is it a boy or a girl?

771
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,373
I can't say for sure.

772
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,940
It looks like a girl.

773
00:28:22,973 --> 00:28:25,207
After having two boys,
that'd be pretty nice, huh?

774
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,340
Mm‐hmm.

775
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,107
Well, I don't see a penis

776
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,107
'but you can't always
tell on an ultrasound.'

777
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,173
You'll have to come back
to the clinic for a follow‐up.

778
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:34,107
Make sure she stays healthy.

779
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,007
Mm‐hmm. I'll do that.

780
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,340
Come on, Corday.

781
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,140
Pull yourself together.

782
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:49,140
It's just a few
more hours to go.

783
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:52,840
Okay.

784
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,473
Hey, Elizabeth.

785
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:07,140
Listen, can you do me a favor?
Can you watch the service?

786
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:08,907
I've got to have a sit‐down
with Dr. Kotlowitz.

787
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,440
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah. I ran into him.

788
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:14,007
I, uh...actually,
I, uh, went looking for him.

789
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,207
Peter, that's terrific.

790
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
Yes, go, go.

791
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,359
I can cover service.

792
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,592
'Thanks.'

793
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:26,992
'Dr. Corday, I need
orders on a new admission.'

794
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,725
I'm not in the mood
for any jokes.

795
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,659
No. Mr. Ramos is back.

796
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:32,659
Ramos? Fem‐pop bypass?

797
00:29:32,692 --> 00:29:33,992
Well, I discharged
him yesterday.

798
00:29:34,025 --> 00:29:35,825
Oh, he's back with
a wound infection

799
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,359
and a pretty bad asthma attack.

800
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,792
You know the bounce‐back rules.

801
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:40,225
Yep, I know. He's mine.

802
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,959
He's on continuous albuterol.

803
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:45,659
Hello, Mr. Ramos.

804
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,925
Let's take a look
at your legs, shall we?

805
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,625
I was hoping you
would be here today.

806
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,759
Well, where else
would I possibly go?

807
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,692
I asked the mother if she'd
given the baby any food.

808
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,325
I guess I was talking
to the wrong person.

809
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,792
The baby's the lucky one,
we can treat botulism.

810
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,192
‐ But what do we do to help Sky?
‐ She's gonna be fine.

811
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:05,025
Her mom's draining all
the childhood out of her.

812
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:07,725
Now, look, as much neglect
and abuse as I see

813
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,292
trust me, Sky is okay.

814
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,292
Yeah, a little girl needs
to be a little girl, though.

815
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:12,925
Yeah, that's true.

816
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,992
Hey, guys.

817
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:17,192
Okay, now, um..

818
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,259
'You can't give
honey to your brother'

819
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,225
'or to any baby because it
can hurt them. Is that okay?'

820
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,759
'Honey can have
botulism spores.'

821
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,059
'Their intestines are immature'

822
00:30:26,092 --> 00:30:28,592
'and they can't
kill off the spores.'

823
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,959
'He's maxed out with
a pressure of 65.'

824
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,725
Systemic resistance is 3,500.

825
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,125
Let's start levophed.

826
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:36,192
Dr. Corday,
I need you over here.

827
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,925
Mr. Ramos is pretty tight.

828
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:38,959
Okay.

829
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:41,292
‐ Oh!
‐ You okay?

830
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,159
Yep, yep. I'm fine.

831
00:30:45,725 --> 00:30:46,959
How much albuterol?

832
00:30:46,992 --> 00:30:48,892
20 an hour.

833
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:49,925
He's had solumedrol?

834
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:52,725
‐ 125 in the ER.
‐ Okay.

835
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,859
‐ I'll push some magnesium.
‐ Magnesium?

836
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:56,659
Yep, it relaxes
the smooth muscles

837
00:30:56,692 --> 00:30:58,325
of the bronchioles,
second line agent.

838
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,992
Dr. Corday, can you
come look at Mr. Frybush?

839
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,992
Give me five minutes, okay?

840
00:31:02,025 --> 00:31:04,692
Hey, Carter, can you
explain this evaluation to me.

841
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:07,092
If things were going this bad,
you should have come to me.

842
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,092
Do you have something
personal against this girl?

843
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,625
‐ Wait a sec‐‐
‐ I want to see you and Lucy.

844
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:12,892
And we're gonna figure this out.

845
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,592
Find her and then find me.

846
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,092
‐ Can I hang onto that?
‐ No.

847
00:31:18,892 --> 00:31:20,059
Sounds like you're
in a good mood.

848
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:22,225
Oh, hey, can you do me a favor?

849
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:24,825
I need a place to crash tonight.
My building's being fumigated.

850
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:27,092
‐ Do you think Carol would mind?
‐ Are you kiddin'? Come on over.

851
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,059
‐ Save me a few bucks.
‐ Sure thing.

852
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,959
‐ Glad to have you.
‐ Thanks.

853
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:31,992
He's set up for another

854
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:34,892
four hours of continuous.

855
00:31:34,925 --> 00:31:35,925
Okay.

856
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,792
Magnesium's on board.

857
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:40,859
How are you feeling, Mr. Ramos?

858
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:42,259
‐ Dizzy.
‐ Whoa, whoa.

859
00:31:42,292 --> 00:31:44,725
‐ What's happening?
‐ Maybe he's hypoxic.

860
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,892
How much mag did you give him?

861
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:48,092
Two grams slow IV Push, 40cc's.

862
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,192
40cc's of 50% mag sulfate?

863
00:31:50,225 --> 00:31:52,625
Not 50%, five percent.

864
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,125
No. Dr. Corday,
you gave him 50%.

865
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,892
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're right.

866
00:31:57,925 --> 00:31:59,859
I've given him a lethal dose.
He's not breathing.

867
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:01,125
Number eight ETT Tube!

868
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:02,359
He's bradying down,
heart rate's 30.

869
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:03,992
Okay, two grams
of calcium gluconate.

870
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,825
Push an amp of atropine.

871
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,092
Bag him. Prep for an IJ.
I'll float a pacemaker.

872
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,759
Lost the pulse. We're in PEA.

873
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:13,792
I'll start chest compressions.

874
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:15,092
Seven and half gloves

875
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:16,859
and an eight French
cordis introducer.

876
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:24,692
The cochlear implant is
nothing short of a miracle

877
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,592
and the technology
keeps improving.

878
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:27,992
Yeah. Now, I'm impressed
by what I've read.

879
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:29,725
Oh, well, no,
don't read‐don't read.

880
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:31,759
Talk to people who have it.
Talk to parents of the children.

881
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,025
As a matter of fact,
I can get you in touch

882
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,092
with a number of
people who've faced

883
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,692
exactly what you're facing now.

884
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:38,225
Great. I mean, I've already
heard an earful

885
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,625
from the opponents, so..

886
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:40,925
Oh, the fanatics, hm‐mm.

887
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,692
Yeah, well, they've
got their agendas.

888
00:32:42,725 --> 00:32:44,692
Alright, the level of passion
with which these people

889
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:47,325
will attack you, it's, uh,
it's bizarre...it's bizarre.

890
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,959
Somebody actually used
the word "genocidal."

891
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:50,992
Said I was trying to
eradicate deaf culture.

892
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,359
Wow.

893
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:54,292
Deafness is not some
alternative lifestyle

894
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:55,825
and the people who
claim it is, I mean

895
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,725
they're...they're
beyond reasoning with.

896
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,259
Yeah, look, the thing I'm tryin'
to figure out is

897
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:02,025
why make an argument against
hearing and speaking, you know?

898
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,259
Honestly, you wanna
know what I think?

899
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:06,659
I think it comes
down to laziness.

900
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:08,292
I think a deaf person can
function in the hearing world

901
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:09,725
but some of these
people, they just

902
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,992
don't want to do
all the exercises

903
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,792
and do all the drills
that it takes.

904
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,325
Yeah, look, I mean,
uh...it's years of hard work.

905
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,359
Yeah, but they have the
energy to attack me

906
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:18,859
and other doctors.
So I say, the hell with them.

907
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,892
You do not...do not
stand in my way

908
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:23,925
when I'm trying to help
a person to function.

909
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,025
Hmm. Wow.

910
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:27,159
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

911
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,359
Anyway, anyway, anyway

912
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:31,959
you bring in your‐your son

913
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:34,592
and we'll see if
he's a candidate.

914
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,992
So, uh..

915
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:38,292
You work closely
with Dr. Corday?

916
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:40,725
‐ Actually, she's my intern.
‐ A‐ah, ha.

917
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,359
She told me about the fallout
she had with Rocket Romano.

918
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:44,959
Oh, yeah.

919
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:47,925
Do‐do you know
if she's seeing anybody?

920
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,825
I'm just wondering.

921
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,692
Actually, uh, I'm pretty sure
she's involved with somebody.

922
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,025
Oh, well, I'm not surprised.

923
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:55,325
‐ Yeah.
‐ Oh, well.

924
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,759
‐ Thanks.
‐ Alright, you bet, anytime.

925
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:59,292
Give me a call.

926
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,925
Uh, check, please.

927
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,892
Systolic, 60 palp.

928
00:34:03,925 --> 00:34:06,725
Come on, come on, come on.

929
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,625
We've got capture.

930
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,725
Turning the rate, down to 80.

931
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:14,092
Did you page Dr. Benton?

932
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,859
‐ Done.
‐ Pulse is stronger.

933
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,792
‐ Good.
‐ Pupils are fixed and dilated.

934
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,325
Oh, that could be the atropine.

935
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,225
That, or he stroked out.
What happened?

936
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,025
I inadvertently gave him
enough magnesium

937
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,792
to cause a cardiac
arrest...20 grams.

938
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,059
Oh, no.

939
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,325
I looked at the label.
I thought it said..

940
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:33,292
...five percent, but it was 50%.

941
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:34,892
But I looked at the label.

942
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:38,825
Hey, I got your blood work back.

943
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:39,959
Oh, thanks, Lynette.

944
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:41,225
Progesterone level's normal.

945
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:42,325
That's good news, right?

946
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,592
Means you ovulated.

947
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:44,925
Yeah, except I've been trying

948
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,592
to get pregnant and I haven't.

949
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:47,859
Well, how long have
you been at it?

950
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:48,859
Couple of months.

951
00:34:48,892 --> 00:34:49,925
Oh, Carol, come on.

952
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:51,125
Give yourself at
least six months

953
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,925
before you start
worrying about it.

954
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,859
Yeah, you're right. I'm crazy.

955
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,692
Maybe you guys need to
increase your sexual activity.

956
00:34:57,725 --> 00:35:00,159
How often do you,
you know, do the "do"?

957
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:01,892
‐ What?
‐ Oh, sorry.

958
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,125
Am I being indiscreet?

959
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,825
‐ Yeah.
‐ Carol, what's the deal?

960
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,625
I went in to see
your rule‐out ectopic

961
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,059
and she's dressed
and ready to leave.

962
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:09,292
‐ Maria Jones?
‐ Yeah.

963
00:35:09,325 --> 00:35:11,625
She pulled her IV?

964
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:13,325
Hey, Maria, where are you going?

965
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,159
I'm feeling better, nurse.
I'm going home.

966
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,859
Wait a minute, you came
in here in so much pain

967
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:18,159
I couldn't even examine you.

968
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:19,592
But I'm better now.

969
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,325
Wait, wait, uh, we
need to make sure

970
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,359
that everything is okay
with you and the baby.

971
00:35:23,392 --> 00:35:25,759
Just let the doctor look you
over and what's the hurry?

972
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,792
Look, I just wanted to know
if it was a boy or a girl.

973
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,092
And nothing wrong, so
why worry about it?

974
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,659
Wait, wait, wait!

975
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:33,225
You‐you were faking
those abdominal pains?

976
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:35,092
Girl, are you crazy?

977
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,792
But you said you weren't even
sure you were pregnant.

978
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:39,225
I mean, why would you lie
and‐and cause all that drama

979
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:41,892
just to find out
if it's a boy or..

980
00:35:41,925 --> 00:35:44,025
Oh, no. Are you gonna
abort this baby?

981
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,192
‐ What? Get of me!
‐ Carol!

982
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:47,592
She's had two boys
and two abortions.

983
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,159
Are you gonna get rid of this
child because you think it's a‐‐

984
00:35:49,192 --> 00:35:51,059
It's my baby and I'll do
what I wanna do with it‐‐

985
00:35:51,092 --> 00:35:53,792
I told you, that
ultrasound is inconclusive.

986
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:55,759
‐ It could be a boy.
‐ Lady, take your hands off me.

987
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:56,859
Unless you really
wanna fight me.

988
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:58,192
Step away, Carol. Let her go.

989
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,125
Girls ain't nothin'
but trouble anyhow.

990
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,659
What's the matter with you?

991
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,292
What's the matter with you?

992
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:16,325
'How could you inject a patient'

993
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:17,925
'with 20 grams of magnesium?'

994
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,292
I make no excuses.
It was a grievous error.

995
00:36:20,325 --> 00:36:23,792
Where were you during
this misadventure, Dr. Benton?

996
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:25,225
I was out of the hospital

997
00:36:25,259 --> 00:36:27,259
on a personal matter.
I came as soon as I was paged.

998
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:29,225
It wouldn't have mattered even
if he had been in the hospital.

999
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:32,059
You left your
intern unsupervised

1000
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,759
and now this patient may have
suffered hypoxic brain injury.

1001
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,225
I stopped by the unit.

1002
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:38,225
Mr. Ramos' eyes are open
and he's responding to commands.

1003
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,292
You are not to leave
the hospital while on duty

1004
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,925
'and you are not to leave
your intern unsupervised.'

1005
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,625
I know it's hard for us all

1006
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,759
to view Elizabeth as an intern

1007
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,125
but as a consequence
we've opened up

1008
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,125
this hospital
to enormous liability.

1009
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,692
I'll speak to risk management

1010
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,859
and the hospital attorneys.

1011
00:36:58,892 --> 00:37:00,125
They'll determine
what information

1012
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,659
to release to the families.

1013
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:06,125
Don't either of you
discuss this with anyone.

1014
00:37:12,392 --> 00:37:13,792
Could we get together tonight

1015
00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:15,225
and not talk about this?

1016
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:18,325
I have to pick up my son
from, uh, my sister's house.

1017
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,192
Alright.

1018
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,125
You just need to get
a good night's sleep.

1019
00:37:35,792 --> 00:37:37,159
I didn't fill out this
evaluation, Dr. Greene.

1020
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,325
‐ 'Who did?
‐ She did.'

1021
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,359
‐ Why did she?
‐ Because he told me to.

1022
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,125
I didn't tell you
to give it to him.

1023
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,325
‐ I told you to give it to me.
‐ No, you didn't.

1024
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:45,959
Okay, wait.

1025
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,925
Don't talk to each other.
Talk to me.

1026
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,359
Mark..

1027
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,859
...I just wanted to know how
she thought she was doing

1028
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:53,725
before I made
my final assessment.

1029
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:56,092
So, I tried to put myself in
his shoes and be very critical.

1030
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:57,959
He handed me this form
and said, "Fill it out."

1031
00:37:57,992 --> 00:37:59,325
and I assumed that
meant turn it in.

1032
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,892
How could she assume that?

1033
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:03,092
That makes no sense.

1034
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,992
See, that's part of his problem,
he gives incomplete directions.

1035
00:38:06,025 --> 00:38:07,325
Oh, "He gives," I give
incomplete directions.

1036
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,292
‐ 'Name a time.'
‐ 'Just one?'

1037
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:11,925
Tell her to name a time when I
medically gave her incomplete‐‐

1038
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,859
‐ Defensive.
‐ Okay.

1039
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:15,359
Talk to each other.

1040
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:17,092
Don't talk to me.

1041
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,159
Whatever this is,
I can't fix it.

1042
00:38:19,192 --> 00:38:21,192
Work it out...both of you.

1043
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:27,059
Kerry, I need to talk to you
about the variant X‐Ray

1044
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:29,325
interpretation report. Please
don't blow me off this time.

1045
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,959
I'm sorry, Don.
There's a trauma coming in.

1046
00:38:30,992 --> 00:38:33,225
Possible candidate
for the thoracotomy study.

1047
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:34,692
I didn't realize that
was up and running.

1048
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:35,925
Stab wound to the left chest.

1049
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:37,592
Had a pulse in
the field initially.

1050
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,592
Gave him epi,
1500cc's of saline

1051
00:38:39,625 --> 00:38:40,825
and shocked him
twice for V‐tach.

1052
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,659
Perfect candidate.
Lily, got the stopwatch?

1053
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:43,825
Right here.

1054
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:45,059
Do you mind if I tag along?

1055
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,625
Now. Start the timer.

1056
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,592
Here we go.

1057
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:53,225
On my count...
one, two, three.

1058
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:55,259
Hang two units of O‐neg
on the rapid infuser.

1059
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:57,292
Get type specific
as soon as you can.

1060
00:38:57,325 --> 00:38:58,359
Ten blade. Let's go.

1061
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:00,625
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

1062
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:01,892
Seven‐and‐a‐half gloves.

1063
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:05,992
Okay.

1064
00:39:06,025 --> 00:39:09,259
Skin incision is complete.

1065
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:10,825
Mark that time. Saw, please.

1066
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,359
Sternal retractor.

1067
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:29,692
Good job.

1068
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:30,959
I need a purple top.

1069
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,225
Pulse ox 85.

1070
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:33,925
Mark the time.

1071
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,592
Suction, please.

1072
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,925
Pickups and metz.

1073
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,825
Looks like blood
in the pericardium.

1074
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:40,659
First hemoglobin is 9.2.

1075
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:43,759
Okay. Pericardium is open.
Mark the time.

1076
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:46,025
And I've identified a stab
wound to the left ventricle.

1077
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,292
‐ What are we at, Lily?
‐ 42 seconds.

1078
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:50,759
Take over internal compressions.

1079
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,225
Tamponade the wound. Two‐o silk.

1080
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,292
Looks like one horizontal
mattress should do it.

1081
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,192
‐ Two units are in.
‐ Hang another two.

1082
00:39:56,225 --> 00:39:58,792
How's the heart feel, Don?

1083
00:39:58,825 --> 00:39:59,825
Starting to fill.

1084
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,759
Get the paddles ready.

1085
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,759
Okay.
Cardiac injury is repaired.

1086
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,359
‐ Mark the time.
‐ V‐fib.

1087
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:08,859
Charging to 20, and clear.

1088
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:13,925
‐ Sinus rhythm.
‐ Cardiac activity is restored.

1089
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,192
'Record the time.'

1090
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:17,625
‐ I've got a pulse.
‐ Excellent job, Kerry.

1091
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:34,825
‐ Dr. Greene.
‐ Dr. Lee.

1092
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,059
Finding your way around alright?

1093
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:39,159
Yes. Thanks.
I wanted to ask you..

1094
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:40,725
...I didn't feel
I was connecting with you

1095
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:43,359
during my interview.
Is that a correct assessment?

1096
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:44,959
How do you mean?

1097
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,659
Well, I'd look over
at you and wonder

1098
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:48,925
"Am I making my best case here?"

1099
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:49,959
Well, It was a good interview‐‐

1100
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,225
Because I like this department

1101
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,259
and I want this job
and I don't mind saying

1102
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:56,259
I'm one of the baddest
ER bitches out there.

1103
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,159
If I didn't make my best
case during the interview

1104
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:00,292
I'd like to try again right now.

1105
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:02,592
Can I grab a soda
and sit down with you?

1106
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:04,925
Yeah, sure.

1107
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,692
Call me when he's in recovery.

1108
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,292
'Thank you.'

1109
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:14,925
Don, I...I have
something to confess.

1110
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,125
Oh?

1111
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,692
Oh, for a while,
I‐I felt resentment

1112
00:41:18,725 --> 00:41:21,292
when it became clear
I wasn't your choice

1113
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:24,059
to run the emergency
department full time.

1114
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:26,159
Well, it's not that you
weren't qualified, Kerry‐‐

1115
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,625
Oh, hold on.

1116
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,192
Now, I am so grateful

1117
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,325
to be putting all of
myself into medicine

1118
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,192
and I want you to
know there are no

1119
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:37,092
lingering hard
feelings on my part.

1120
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:40,825
Well, I must say, I could
sense the bad feelings

1121
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,759
and I did wish there was
something I could do about it

1122
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,925
because...I value
your friendship.

1123
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:47,992
Well, how's the
job search going?

1124
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:49,959
We interviewed a wonderful woman

1125
00:41:49,992 --> 00:41:51,225
Amanda Lee, out of Atlanta.

1126
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,659
Hm‐mm, I don't know her.

1127
00:41:52,692 --> 00:41:53,992
Why don't you join
us for dinner?

1128
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,692
I'd love to hear
what you think of her.

1129
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:57,159
Don, I'm trying

1130
00:41:57,192 --> 00:41:59,159
but I'm not all
the way there yet.

1131
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,192
Thanks.

1132
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:08,792
Isn't it a little weird living
with one of your bosses?

1133
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:11,325
No. We get along okay,
plus it's a bargain.

1134
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,292
All I have to do
is a little yard work here.

1135
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,659
Clean out the gutters.

1136
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,025
Do the stuff that
she can't handle.

1137
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:16,825
U‐huh?

1138
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:23,592
Roxanne, if you make
me forget this day

1139
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,159
I will owe you
the biggest favor.

1140
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:27,292
Lousy day, huh?

1141
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:30,259
My med student
is driving me crazy.

1142
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,992
Lucy.

1143
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,225
There's so much that
I want to teach her.

1144
00:42:35,259 --> 00:42:36,925
‐ And it's just not happening.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1145
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:38,759
‐ I think I'm not a bad teacher.
‐ No.

1146
00:42:38,792 --> 00:42:40,259
And I don't even think
she's a bad student.

1147
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:42,625
No. You know what?

1148
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:45,092
I can say one good
thing about Lucy.

1149
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,259
She's not here.

1150
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:49,559
Oh, you make a good point.

1151
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:56,259
I didn't mean to
put you to work.

1152
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,959
Oh, no, Mark. Don't be silly.

1153
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,159
This is gonna be nice.

1154
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,359
‐ Oh, man.
‐ You want some more?

1155
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:18,092
No, no. It was good, though.

1156
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:19,625
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1157
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,925
Who's making all that noise?

1158
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,659
What's up, man, huh?

1159
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:24,692
Come on. Let's get
ready to go, huh?

1160
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,925
Come on.
Say goodbye to Aunt Jackie.

1161
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:29,125
Jackie, who gave him this phone?

1162
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,892
Oh, it's a toy, Peter.

1163
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:32,925
It's a cute shape
and he likes it.

1164
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:35,359
Yeah, well, he probably
saw you on it all day.

1165
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:36,725
Hey, hey.

1166
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:37,959
I'm sorry.

1167
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:41,325
You know, we went
to a surgeon today.

1168
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,025
I'm just trying to do what's
best for Reese and I feel like

1169
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:44,992
I'm in the middle of
a battlefield, you know.

1170
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,859
The more information I get,
the less I know what to do.

1171
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,859
I don't really have anybody
to talk it over with, you know.

1172
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:51,292
Well, what about Carla?

1173
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:52,992
Yeah, she..

1174
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:55,592
She's looking for me to
take the lead on this thing.

1175
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,159
I can't be going back and forth
with it over with her, you know.

1176
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,725
'Your girlfriend's a doctor.'

1177
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:01,792
Why can't you talk
with Elizabeth about it?

1178
00:44:01,825 --> 00:44:03,925
Hey, hey.

1179
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:05,559
Peter?

1180
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:08,025
'Hey, come on.'

1181
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:09,259
Peter?

1182
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:11,292
Come on. Hey, man.
