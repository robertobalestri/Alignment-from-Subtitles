1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,033
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:08,433
‐ What happened?
‐ Her husband freaked out.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,133
'Called 9‐1‐1,
but wouldn't let us in.'

4
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,400
She was bleeding
all over the place.

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,033
All this time
I'm worrying about HIV

6
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,766
and I get hepatitis "C"?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,500
My wife,
is she dead?

8
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,766
‐ Kerry, can you get Mark?
‐ Sure, I can do that.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
And security.

10
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,666
I'm going to resign.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,066
You want him to go?

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,133
I love him
like a brother

13
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,166
but I can't do this anymore.
It's too hard.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,566
I can't rem‐remember a time
when I didn't love him.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,166
You're not coming
with me, are you?

16
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,100
I tell you, you got to love
this night shift.

17
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,766
‐ No, you don't.
‐ How's your ride‐along?

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,633
It has been wild. First,
we had these two old guys

19
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:21,500
swimming naked in the lake,
nearly froze their, uh..

20
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,800
Okay, thank you,
we get it.

21
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,633
We got this crazy lady
out in the rig.

22
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,633
‐ Oh, yeah?
‐ Yeah. Bring your coat.

23
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,533
Tried to eat the lovebirds
at the Delaware Hotel.

24
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,800
You're right.
She's crazy.

25
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:38,266
Acutely psychotic.
She's combative.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,700
She locked herself in.
We'll try a little Haldol

27
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,233
before we call for
the bolt cutters.

28
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,400
One, two, three.

29
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,533
Ah, what does she think
she's some kind of hawk?

30
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:49,666
Hawks attack with their claws,
Jerry, not their teeth.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,766
‐ Why is she staring at me.
‐ Maybe she likes you.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,066
You're threatening her
with your gaze.

33
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,233
‐ Look away. Look away.
‐ I‐I'm looking away. Fine.

34
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,600
'...and you're looking
at it right now'

35
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:00,500
'on Nicole's lovely wrist.
It's a winner.'

36
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,166
'It's a knockout.
It really is.'

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,733
'It's a bracelet
that is memorable.'

38
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,766
'It's a bracelet you'll want
to wear every single day.'

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,466
'It's wide, it's bold,
it's beautiful'

40
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,266
'and you know what else?
It's reversible.'

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,633
'How hard would it be for you to
flip that over for me, Nicole?'

42
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,100
'Watch the other side.
Gorgeous.'

43
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,400
'Matte gold
on the other side.'

44
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:19,733
'This beautiful, soft,
satiny matte gold finish'

45
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:22,233
'on the other side
and, then, a high‐polished'

46
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,133
'glam look
on the front side..'

47
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,700
What do you mean, you want me
to wait for Jerry?

48
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,733
I mean, he likes
this kind of stuff.

49
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,400
What stuff?

50
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:31,133
These strange dudes
in the middle of the night.

51
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,400
They're called patients,
Malik, and I'm not waiting.

52
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,600
‐ Mr. Kornberg, hi.
‐ Hi.

53
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,066
‐ I'm, uh, Dr. Weaver.
‐ Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,800
Nice to meet you.
Here you go.

55
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,566
He twisted his
knee wrestling.

56
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,233
Huh, at 3:00
in the morning?

57
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:43,500
No, in last night's match.

58
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,166
Wasn't so bad
till I got up to pee.

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,366
Then it really
started hurting.

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,766
Okay, let's take a look.

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,733
How'd you do it,
flying dropkick?

62
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,266
Jackknife power bomb.

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,333
I thought you guys
never really got hurt.

64
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,133
‐ What's that supposed to mean?
‐ Malik..

65
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,466
Now, come on, man, everybody
know pro wrestling's fake.

66
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,066
‐ Who are you calling fake?
‐ Malik, I think that's enough.

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,700
You, man,
it's all rehearsed.

68
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,300
You and your boys
are a bunch of fakes.

69
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,033
Is that right, yeah?
I'll show you fake.

70
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,333
‐ Hey, man!
‐ Hey, man!

71
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:09,800
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

72
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

73
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:15,300
Mr. Kornberg, I said
put him down right now!

74
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,766
Call security!
I need some help here.

75
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
'Malik, are you alright?'

76
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,500
I got you good.
Oh, man.

77
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:27,233
I wish Jerry
could've seen this.

78
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,666
Sorry.

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,233
Now, he really wanted
to do that.

80
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:37,033
Sit down.

81
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,566
‐ What happened to her son?
‐ He and his wife just left.

82
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,233
They said they'd only
be a few minutes.

83
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,533
Well, they picked a great time.
Mrs. Fong, don't worry.

84
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,033
You're fine.
You're fine.

85
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,633
We're taking you back
to your room now, okay?

86
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,666
Is everything alright?

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,166
Yes, everything's fine.

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,266
Did my mother
have another seizure?

89
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,133
She doesn't remember we
told her we were leaving.

90
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,366
She's fine. She just got
back from her head CT.

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,300
If you don't mind, it would
be best if you stay close.

92
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,033
I don't speak Chinese
and it's difficult

93
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,033
to find an interpreter
at 4:30 in the morning.

94
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:56,066
‐ We needed to get the po chai.
‐ The po chai what?

95
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,600
To settle her stomach.

96
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,266
Oh, I don't think she
should take that right now.

97
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,066
It's only herbs
that make her feel better.

98
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,366
If you don't mind,
I would rather wait

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,100
until all the test
results come back

100
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,533
before giving
her anything.

101
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,100
'How's she doing?'

102
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,766
Haldol's kicked in
and maintenance is here

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,100
to cut open the cage. Psych
should be down in a few minutes.

104
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,733
Yo, John, got to go.

105
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,200
Okay. Hey, we're sorry
to dump her on you.

106
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,700
Hey, that's our job.

107
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,100
Carter, you wouldn't be stealing
those supplies, would you?

108
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:22,466
‐ Of course not.
‐ Thank you, Yosh.

109
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Didn't think so.
Malik..

110
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,733
Ah, Dr. Weaver.

111
00:05:25,766 --> 00:05:27,433
Yeah, about Mr. Kornberg..

112
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:29,466
Yeah, look, I asked him first.
He could've said no.

113
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,033
Look, a patient comes in
with a bad knee

114
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:32,166
and you want him
to do tricks?

115
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,466
Yeah, but that's
what these guys do.

116
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,533
And Kornberg's a major
contender. He's the man.

117
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:37,033
Okay, everybody,
let's break it up.

118
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,266
Hey, uh, let me
get one for my mom.

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,700
‐ Okay.
‐ 'Here we go. One more.'

120
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,200
'Jerry.'

121
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,433
Uh, okay, everybody,
that's it for now.

122
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,133
‐ No, that's it, period.
‐ You're looking good, man.

123
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,233
Hey, you ready
to take on the hybrid?

124
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:48,733
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Malik..

125
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,233
...I think I can handle this
on my own, thank you.

126
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:54,033
Sure.

127
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,466
Mr. Kornberg, I'm sorry
about all this attention.

128
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,033
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

129
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay, you have some bleeding
inside the knee.

130
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,466
So, I'm going to numb it
and tap the joint.

131
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
That should decrease
some of the pain.

132
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,733
I've had that
done before.

133
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,666
Oh, this isn't
your first injury?

134
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,466
You name it,
I broke it.

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,133
That sounds like
a rough sport.

136
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,600
Living on the road
200 nights a year

137
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,100
and getting mobbed by
40,000 screaming fans..

138
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,366
...that's what's rough.

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,700
Oh, I've only surfed by
on cable, but it..

140
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:22,800
You know, it seems like
a profession for showoffs.

141
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,400
You don't...you don't like
the celebrity, huh?

142
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,533
Well, just give them
what they want.

143
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,333
What would you
rather do?

144
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,100
You'd laugh
if I told you.

145
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:33,366
I will try not to.

146
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
I'd like to move
to Montana..

147
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,700
Lots of land,
peace and quiet.

148
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,666
Oh, really?
You'd raise cattle?

149
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,733
Nah, I'd like to have
a farm...grow sugar beets.

150
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,766
‐ Really.
‐ Go ahead and laugh.

151
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm‐I'm not going
to laugh.

152
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:48,233
That's okay. I do.

153
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:49,466
Okay..

154
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,733
There.
Does that feel better?

155
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:54,733
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Good.

156
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:56,166
'You going to wake Maloney?'

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,466
Not at this hour.
He only gets up

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,533
for admissions
and code blues.

159
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,233
Want me to
talk to them?

160
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,566
No, I can do it.

161
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,433
Um, Mr. and Mrs. Fong, I'm
afraid I have some bad news.

162
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,533
Emily, why don't you go inside

163
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,066
and keep your
grandmother company?

164
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
‐ In a minute.
‐ It'd be better if you..

165
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,300
It's okay, dad.

166
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,700
Yes, Miss Knight?

167
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,533
Uh, your mother has
a tumor in her lung

168
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,233
and it has spread
to her brain.

169
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,366
That's what caused
the seizures.

170
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,333
It's cancer at a
very advanced stage.

171
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,700
Oh, my God!

172
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:34,800
I know this news is
difficult to take in.

173
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,100
We've known about
the cancer for a year.

174
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:39,433
‐ Why didn't you tell me?
‐ You were away, at school.

175
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,133
You couldn't call?

176
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,400
Uh, maybe if you take some time
to discuss this..

177
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,033
We did not want
to upset you.

178
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,633
Well, this is worse,
not even knowing.

179
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,666
Why don't I let you talk
about this and I will come back

180
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,466
and review the results
with your mother, okay?

181
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,233
That won't be necessary.

182
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,066
My mother does not know
about the cancer.

183
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,266
'You haven't told her?'

184
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,533
We're not going
to tell her.

185
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:00,166
She should be seeing
an oncologist

186
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,100
and getting treatment.

187
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,233
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

188
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,733
This news
will only depress her.

189
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,300
'She will die sooner
for knowing.'

190
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,333
Radiation therapy can
improve the quality

191
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,666
of her life and
stop the seizures

192
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,333
but she has
to be informed.

193
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:14,566
We are not telling her

194
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,200
and we do not want
you to tell her.

195
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:17,566
You're right,
Miss Knight.

196
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,100
You do not understand.

197
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,266
Can't talk to them
when they're like this.

198
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,400
‐ Like what?
‐ Traditional.

199
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,766
I guess that's
the polite word.

200
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,300
What's her prognosis?

201
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,233
It's a stage‐four cancer.

202
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,633
What does that mean?

203
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,633
She probably has a few months.

204
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,466
Wish they told me.

205
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,133
I could've spent
more time with her.

206
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:05,166
You said something
about treatment.

207
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,433
'Well, she could have
radiation therapy'

208
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,766
'and maybe chemo,
but I don't know'

209
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,500
how we'd treat her
if we can't tell her.

210
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,300
They think if she hears
about the cancer

211
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,200
she'll lose
her will to live.

212
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,500
And what do you think?

213
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,066
You think she'd want to know?

214
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,766
I think she's a tough lady.

215
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,266
She'd want to fight this.

216
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,366
'Malik, what do you got?'

217
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Mr. Kingsley started
vomiting at 2:00 a. m.

218
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:32,100
I ate the steak
tartare at Fletcher's.

219
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:33,433
Never again.

220
00:09:33,466 --> 00:09:35,300
‐ Steak what?
‐ Raw beef, raw egg yolk.

221
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
Start him on five of Compazine,
a liter of saline.

222
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,333
Is that who I
think it is?

223
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:42,166
‐ What, you know Kornberg, man?
‐ Know him?

224
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,633
He's the best
since Freddie Blassie.

225
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,466
Wait a minute.
Freddie, who?

226
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,566
He used to bite the hell out
of his opponents' foreheads..

227
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,166
...in the '60s.

228
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,633
Oh, you're too young.

229
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,233
Jerry, I thought I told you

230
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:56,666
to leave
Mr. Kornberg alone.

231
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,100
‐ It's okay.
‐ No, it's not.

232
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,366
You know, I'm taking him
up to radiology.

233
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,300
Well, what happened
to transport?

234
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,600
They were backed up, so I
thought I'd lend them a hand.

235
00:10:04,633 --> 00:10:07,133
Hey, dude, remember that one
pay‐per‐view when Jericho

236
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,400
messed up your shoulder and you
went down for a two count?

237
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,333
Yeah.

238
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,600
Yeah, but you had to come back
with the jackhammer

239
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,233
slide slam, right?

240
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:15,600
‐ That's right.
‐ Kornberg's the bomb.

241
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,033
Jerry..

242
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,800
Okay, okay, come on, dude.
Malik..

243
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,800
Hey, how come you never
wrestled tag‐team, man?

244
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
You and Stinger
would be unbeatable.

245
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,633
'He's got that corner drop
that's like..'

246
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,666
I called the floor.
Bed'll be ready at 7:00.

247
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,400
Okay, thanks.

248
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,566
Mrs. Fong,
who do you want

249
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,133
to make decisions
about your health?

250
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,133
She says to talk
to my father.

251
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,700
I don't know maybe
we shouldn't do this.

252
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:58,266
If there is any news about
your condition, good or bad

253
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,600
who do you want
us to talk to?

254
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:10,133
She says a year ago
my father told her

255
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,533
she had tuberculosis.

256
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,233
They must've told her that
instead of telling her

257
00:11:14,266 --> 00:11:16,233
she had cancer.

258
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,666
Cancer?

259
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,300
'Repeat‐‐'

260
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,366
Unit 47 requesting police backup
3800 block of Drexel.

261
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,533
Sons of bitches, they threatened
to burn down my building!

262
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:26,433
Settle down, Mr. Leonelli.
Hold that to your head.

263
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,400
Yeah and we still might.
It's the only way we keep warm.

264
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,566
Why don't you have
a seat up here?

265
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,133
Why didn't you call the cops?

266
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,700
Because they'd haul
his ass off to jail.

267
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,666
Landlords can't pull that kinda
crap and get away with it.

268
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,366
Shut up, Felonia! You haven't
paid your rent in two months.

269
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,666
‐ C'mon. Take the other side.
‐ I got it.

270
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,266
You still can't turn
the heat up, man.

271
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,200
My grandmother's upstairs
freezing to death.

272
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,400
‐ Get a job, you dumb ass.
‐ You're the dumb ass.

273
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:46,066
Hey, back off!

274
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,600
Let's get him out of here.

275
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,600
‐ They could have killed me.
‐ I mean, look at this.

276
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:50,700
Turn the heat on, man.

277
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,166
Pay your rent,
I'll turn it on.

278
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,366
Hey, hey!

279
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,600
Throw your beer bottles
at me now.

280
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,227
Take it easy, everybody.

281
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,360
This isn't helping anything.

282
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,827
Get back!

283
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,527
‐ Dwight, you okay?
‐ Yeah, I got blood in my eyes.

284
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Get the hell out of here.
They're a bunch of animals.

285
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:15,093
Is Lars trying
to be a diplomat?

286
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:18,060
'Just back up a step.
Son of a bitch!'

287
00:12:18,093 --> 00:12:20,527
Get me out of here.

288
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,393
‐ When did it start, Lily?
‐ About two minutes ago.

289
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,793
'Somebody help her.'

290
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,593
‐ I've got more Ativan.
‐ Push another two.

291
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,527
‐ Lucy, protect the air wave.
‐ Do something, please.

292
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
‐ Dilantin's onboard.
‐ Load it with a gram.

293
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,327
You did this.
You upset her.

294
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,793
What's he talking
about, Lucy?

295
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:35,660
You told her about the cancer.
She said you did.

296
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:36,827
'And look what it's done.'

297
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,693
‐ 'How's the pulse ox?'
‐ 96.

298
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,827
We asked you not to,
but you wouldn't listen.

299
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,027
This is your fault.
All your fault.

300
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:46,293
'Out of the way!'

301
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,627
Dispatch from RA‐47,
still waiting for police backup.

302
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,127
Give me the keys.
Let's get out of here.

303
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,293
‐ Now you're talking.
‐ Lars okay?

304
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,660
I don't know.

305
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:57,127
Yeah, he's alright. He's just
having trouble getting through.

306
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,493
They don't want him,
they want you.

307
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:04,527
‐ How do you work the PA?
‐ Bottom button.

308
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,393
Everybody stand away
from the vehicle.

309
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:08,293
'We're coming through.'

310
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:10,327
Step back from the vehicle.

311
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,293
Stand back!
We're coming through.

312
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:14,360
Get off the car!

313
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,627
'Everybody, please stand back.'

314
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,293
Get away from the rig.

315
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:21,527
Coming through, nice and easy.

316
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,293
'Stop! Stop!'

317
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,827
'What was that?'

318
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,827
I don't know.

319
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,493
I think we ran over something.

320
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:30,627
‐ It must've been the curb.
‐ Look out the back.

321
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,127
Give me some room.

322
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,560
There's a guy down.
Lars is with him.

323
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:36,593
‐ Oh, God! Did I run him over?
‐ I don't know.

324
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:38,493
‐ We got to stop.
‐ No way. We gotta go.

325
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,193
‐ Go, Carter, go.
‐ We got to pick him up.

326
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:43,127
They'll finish this guy
off first. Drive, Carter!

327
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,093
Oh, God.

328
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,727
'This is unit 47 requesting
second paramedic unit

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,427
3800 block of Drexel.

330
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,093
A man is down.
Ambulance versus pedestrian.

331
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,327
Oh, God.

332
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
‐ Morning!
‐ Hey, Mark.

333
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:03,560
Another headache?

334
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,593
Same as yesterday.

335
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,193
Mmm. Did it ever go away?

336
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:09,460
In the afternoon.

337
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,060
Like I said yesterday,
you should let me do a CT.

338
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:14,460
I don't need
a head CT, Mark.

339
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,560
Well, at least let me
do a neuro exam.

340
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:20,260
Mark, you have to stop
thinking like a doctor.

341
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,227
We both know what's
causing these headaches.

342
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,360
How's your insomnia?

343
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:26,260
It's gone.

344
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,027
Did you talk to him?

345
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:33,293
No. We both thought
it was better

346
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,093
not calling for
a while, you know?

347
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:36,493
Give it some time.

348
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,760
You know, you don't need
me to tell you this

349
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,627
but it's okay for
you to miss him.

350
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,093
Hell, I miss him.

351
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,527
I know. I'm okay,
though, you know?

352
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,593
I‐I actually like
coming to work.

353
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:50,293
Really? Now I am worried
about you.

354
00:14:50,327 --> 00:14:52,060
Move over.

355
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,660
These guys saved my ass. They
really did. It was a great job.

356
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,260
If you'd turned on the heat,
we wouldn't have had to.

357
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,560
'Dr. Carter.'

358
00:14:57,593 --> 00:14:59,060
He's got no neuro deficits.

359
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,793
‐ Just that head lac.
‐ What happened?

360
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,660
Mr. Leonelli decided to
instigate a little civil unrest.

361
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,193
Your typical "angry mob"
kind of thing.

362
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,693
They started it, not me.

363
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,360
Dispatch, can you tell me
what unit was sent

364
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:09,760
to 38th and Drexel?

365
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:12,660
They still on‐scene?
What's their ETA?

366
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,727
‐ Here. You should change that.
‐ Oh, thanks.

367
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,060
Okay, follow my finger with
your eyes. Here we go. Good.

368
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,660
This time's going to teach
them a lesson, isn't it?

369
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:23,060
The lesson, Mr. Leonelli, is you
need to figure out a better way

370
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:24,093
of dealing with
your tenants.

371
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,360
Carter, outside.

372
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,127
What do you know
about my business?

373
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,393
They don't pay their rent.
They leave the place a mess!

374
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,360
So turning off the heat.
That's the way to solve that?

375
00:15:32,393 --> 00:15:34,227
Carter, I said
outside, now.

376
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:38,493
There seems to be a problem
with this patient.

377
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,093
‐ He'll be fine.
‐ Well, then.

378
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:41,427
the problem's with you.
So why don't you go

379
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,627
cool off and I'll
finish him up? Go on.

380
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:53,393
‐ Will she wake up?
‐ It's hard to say.

381
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,693
And if she does will there
be permanent damage?

382
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:57,460
After a prolonged
seizure there could be

383
00:15:57,493 --> 00:15:59,393
some confusion
or memory loss.

384
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:01,260
She could have
had a stroke.

385
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,227
Uh, I want to talk
to a more senior physician.

386
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,493
I'm not happy
with her care.

387
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,093
'Everything was done
properly, Mr. Fong.'

388
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,527
A medicine attending will
see her when she's upstairs

389
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,227
and we'll check back
in a while.

390
00:16:19,727 --> 00:16:21,827
'It was a championship
tag team match.'

391
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,627
This giant of a guy
twirls him around

392
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,260
then suddenly he stops..

393
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,560
...picks him up,
threw him down..

394
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,393
I took Mr. Leonelli
to X‐ray.

395
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:31,493
He'll be there
for a while.

396
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:33,560
Eh, thanks.
Thanks, Yosh.

397
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,293
Good morning.
Always a pleasure

398
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,527
to welcome the day shift.

399
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,593
Hey, Jerry,
what's with the boxes?

400
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,127
They're for pedes.

401
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,793
Well, why aren't they
in the pedes room?

402
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:43,327
Well, they're addressed to
Dr. Ross, so I'm not sure

403
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,560
if I'm supposed to keep them
or forward 'em

404
00:16:44,593 --> 00:16:46,093
or send them
somewhere else.

405
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,560
Jerry, we're still
seeing kids just like

406
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:49,427
we did before
we had a pedes attending.

407
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,293
Come on, Jerry.
Help me with the boxes.

408
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,193
So, Kerry, how was
the graveyard shift?

409
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:54,727
Well, it was
fairly typical.

410
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,427
Just a few "strange dudes"
as Malik would say‐‐

411
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,760
Including Dr. Carter.

412
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,260
Oh, I thought he was
on a ride‐along.

413
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:01,560
He was.

414
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:03,227
Dr. Carter, we were
talking about you.

415
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,760
‐ Did you settle down?
‐ Yeah.

416
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:06,727
Well, Mr. Leonelli's
back in X‐ray

417
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,327
if you want to tell him
that you're sorry..

418
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,460
I got a bigger problem.
We got an MVA coming in.

419
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:12,660
Ambulance versus pedestrian,
and we were the ambulance.

420
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:16,293
Just, uh, set them
down here?

421
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,527
Yeah.
Anywhere's fine.

422
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:20,460
‐ Thanks, Jer.
‐ Sure.

423
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,327
Avery Campbell, 17,
crushed pelvis.

424
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,227
BP, 70 at the scene,
up to 80 with two liters.

425
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,793
‐ Lars, are you okay?
‐ Yeah. I'm fine.

426
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:38,593
They weren't mad at me.

427
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:40,293
‐ This guy needs an airway.
‐ Okay.

428
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,693
One of pavulon,
two of versed, 100 of sux.

429
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:45,227
Number eight ET tube.

430
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
CBC, type and cross
for eight.

431
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:49,193
Chem 20. Let's get
a portable chest.

432
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,060
AP pelvis in prep
for a central line.

433
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,093
BP 75 palp,
pulse ox 88.

434
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:55,427
‐ Two units of O‐neg.
‐ What do we got?

435
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,493
'Ambulance ran over
this guy's pelvis.'

436
00:17:57,527 --> 00:17:58,527
Hope you weren't
driving, Doris.

437
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,060
No. It was me.

438
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,093
And you're not
supposed to drive.

439
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,660
I know that. Are you in?

440
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:05,127
'Yeah, I'm in.
Bag him.'

441
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,393
Where were the paramedics?

442
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,227
I got trapped outside
in the crowd.

443
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,593
How's the airway?

444
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:11,393
Good breath sounds.

445
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,560
What about Zadro?

446
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:13,827
He was bleeding. Couldn't see.

447
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,427
‐ Blood at the meatus.
‐ Damn it!

448
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,827
'Could have torn his urethra.'

449
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,427
I'll prep for
a retrograde urethrogram.

450
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,560
I'll need a supraumbilical
peritoneal lavage.

451
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:21,693
‐ Why didn't you call the cops?
‐ We did.

452
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,227
Why didn't you
wait for them?

453
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,627
Can we talk
about this later. Come on.

454
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,227
Will you hook this up
to the rapid infuser?

455
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,493
I need betadine
sterile gloves and a Foley.

456
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:29,627
Come on!

457
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,693
‐ Hey, Jeanie.
‐ Good morning.

458
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:37,227
‐ Getting settled back in?
‐ Yeah. I'm doing okay.

459
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,393
Any side effects
from the interferon?

460
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:41,427
‐ No.
‐ Good.

461
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,393
You know, maybe you should do
fast track today..

462
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,827
'sore throats,
sprained ankles. Easy stuff.'

463
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,793
I think I'll stick
with triage and paperwork.

464
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,493
Okay. Uh, Jeanie..

465
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,327
...Al called here
last night.

466
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,193
‐ Did you speak to him?
‐ Yeah.

467
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,727
He was upset about
the message that you left him.

468
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
‐ He couldn't reach you, so..
‐ Yeah.

469
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:04,293
Well, thanks, Kerry,
but I can handle this.

470
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:07,060
I know. It's just that
he sounded concerned.

471
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:10,127
Right. Well, I've had
every conversation with Al

472
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,227
I'll ever need to have.

473
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,660
I find out on top
of everything else

474
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,293
that he's given me
hepatitis "C"

475
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,627
so there's really nothing
else to talk about.

476
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,193
I got to cover
a meeting for Romano

477
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,227
but do you want
to grab a bite to eat later?

478
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,560
No, thanks. I'm having
lunch with a friend.

479
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:26,360
Okay. Sure.

480
00:19:26,393 --> 00:19:29,727
Got a ruptured bladder
and an open book fracture.

481
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,293
‐ Lavage is negative.
‐ Pressure's up to 95.

482
00:19:32,327 --> 00:19:33,760
Let's get him
to angio.

483
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,693
‐ Good work, Carter.
‐ Not out of the woods yet.

484
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:36,760
I'll track down
urology and ortho

485
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:38,360
let them know
what's going on.

486
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:40,160
His dad's outside.
Wants to talk to someone.

487
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,260
I should do that.

488
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,593
I don't think
that's a good idea.

489
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:44,393
Well, I was there.
Oh, right, I did it.

490
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,560
Exactly.

491
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:47,327
Still, it's
my responsibility.

492
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,393
Alright, but remember, you're
this kid's doctor first. Okay?

493
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:53,427
Only talk to the father
about his medical condition.

494
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,793
Oh, Carter, I want you
and Zadro and Audia to find me

495
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,127
and fill me in on exactly
what happened, okay.

496
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,260
That way, I can defend
your actions to the police

497
00:20:01,293 --> 00:20:03,527
the hospital administration,
fire department

498
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,493
and the media, if necessary.
Does that make sense?

499
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:06,727
Mr. Campbell?

500
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,793
‐ My God. Is he alright?
‐ I'm Dr. Carter.

501
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:11,260
Mr. Campbell, Avery's
got a broken pelvis

502
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,527
and some
internal bleeding.

503
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Does that mean
you have to operate?

504
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,127
No. Not
necessarily.

505
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,793
A radiologist will
use a catheter

506
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:18,727
to stop the bleeding
in his pelvic arteries.

507
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,160
'Hey, Avery..'

508
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:21,327
Um, how long
does that take?

509
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,693
About an hour or so.

510
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:25,227
They said an ambulance
ran him over. Is that right?

511
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,127
Uh, uh,
I believe so.

512
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,260
Yeah, but I mean, how could
that happen, huh?

513
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:30,593
As I say,
we'll know more about

514
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:31,827
his condition
in about an hour.

515
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,393
Sorry, I don't
mean to bug you but

516
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:35,160
I sure as hell am
going to bug somebody

517
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,160
because somebody here's going
to have to pay for that.

518
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,627
Thank you very much,
doctor, okay.

519
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:44,293
Looks good, Debbie.
Any pain?

520
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,527
It's been
kind of throbbing.

521
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,060
I had a lot
of trouble sleeping.

522
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,193
That shouldn't
last for long.

523
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:50,360
Will it be gone
by tonight?

524
00:20:50,393 --> 00:20:52,093
I mean, a lot of trouble.

525
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,593
We'll give
you something.

526
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,593
Jeanie, let's write her
for a few vicodin

527
00:20:55,627 --> 00:20:57,360
and I'll see you
in the office in two days.

528
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,693
‐ Do I keep the splint on?
‐ Yeah.

529
00:20:58,727 --> 00:21:01,193
You have to
let the tendon heal.

530
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,527
Uh, where's my
prescription pad?

531
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,093
‐ Did you drop it?
‐ I hate when this happens.

532
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,793
Carol, how's your headache?

533
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:10,627
‐ Oh, not bad.
‐ Yeah? Still there?

534
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,593
Mark, you have to stop treating
me like I have a brain tumor.

535
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,727
Okay. Okay.
Jerry, who is that

536
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
big guy over there
in curtain area two?

537
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:18,460
He looks familiar.

538
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,627
Yeah, no kidding he looks
familiar. It's Kornberg.

539
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,560
Oh, right, that's
who it is.

540
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:25,527
I hate to be such a girl,
but who's Kornberg?

541
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,793
Used to be a defensive end
for the Denver Broncos.

542
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:30,193
If anybody needs me,
I'm in the suture room.

543
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:32,693
Obviously, Dr. Greene
is not a wrestling fan.

544
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,127
What?

545
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,627
Jerry, would you hand me
a pen, please?

546
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,293
‐ Sure.
‐ Thank you.

547
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:43,293
Pharmacy's on
the second floor.

548
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:47,193
‐ Here you go.
‐ Thank you.

549
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:49,427
So, uh, did you get my message
about Saturday night?

550
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Yeah. I've been
meaning to call.

551
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,260
I'm afraid
I can't make it.

552
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:54,593
Really? I have reservations
at Charlie Trotter's.

553
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,227
That sounds great,
but I can't.

554
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,060
Let's do it Sunday,
if that's better.

555
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:00,793
Actually, you know, Graham,
I need to tell you something.

556
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:02,193
I feel really
awkward because

557
00:22:02,227 --> 00:22:04,360
I should have
been more up front..

558
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:06,327
...from the get
go, but, uh..

559
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,627
...I'm seeing
someone else.

560
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,493
Oh.

561
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,260
‐ Right.
‐ I'm sorry.

562
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,727
I'll see you
around, then.

563
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,760
Yeah.

564
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,793
'Hello. Can we help you?'

565
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,527
Does this thing even work?

566
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,493
‐ Yeah. Used to.
‐ Jerry, what did you do?

567
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:26,227
I didn't do anything. It's
the alarm inside the bathroom.

568
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,593
‐ Hello.
‐ Which bathroom?

569
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:29,560
‐ Trauma hallway.
‐ Intercom doesn't seem to work.

570
00:22:29,593 --> 00:22:34,327
Oh, my God. I sent Mr. Kingsley
in there for a stool sample.

571
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,393
‐ Have you seen Mr. Kingsley?
‐ He wasn't feeling so well.

572
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,093
It's probably just
a false alarm, right?

573
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,227
Mr. Kingsley!

574
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,727
Mr. Kingsley,
are you alright?

575
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,793
Let me see.

576
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:47,693
‐ It's definitely locked.
‐ Where's the key?

577
00:22:47,727 --> 00:22:49,693
‐ What? I'm supposed to have it?
‐ Call security!

578
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,627
He may have vaso‐vagalled
and passed out.

579
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,393
‐ He could have had an MI.
‐ Might be dead.

580
00:22:53,427 --> 00:22:55,793
Jerry!
Mr. Kingsley!

581
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:57,793
We need to get this door
open right now.

582
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,393
Excuse me.
Stand back.

583
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:07,627
'Mr. Kornberg'

584
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,760
Mr. Kingsley?
Lydia, get a gurney!

585
00:23:12,793 --> 00:23:14,593
‐ Dude, that was awesome.
‐ Mr. Kornberg, are you alright?

586
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,327
Yeah.

587
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,060
‐ Make it two gurneys.
‐ Right.

588
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:29,760
Man, all the good stuff
happens on the night shift.

589
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,593
Hm. This photo's
going to be framed

590
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,293
and put up
on the mantelpiece.

591
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:36,627
The unbeatable tag team
of Markovic and Kornberg.

592
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,460
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Oh, I don't think so, Jer.

593
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,160
What are you talking about?
I could have been a contender.

594
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:41,560
I'm the transport,
county jail.

595
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:43,293
I'm looking for
Dr. Mark Greene.

596
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:45,493
I've got an inmate
he's treated before.

597
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,560
‐ Mobilaje Ekabo.
‐ Mobalage.

598
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,660
Hasn't been eating or drinking.
I need to get him checked out.

599
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:51,827
He's dehydrated. We need
to get him on IV fluids.

600
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,127
Randi, get Mark Greene.

601
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,427
Hey, Carter, is this the kid?
How's he doing?

602
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,327
Yeah. No, he's..hang
one second.

603
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,193
Mr. Leonelli?

604
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,693
I just want
to apologize.

605
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:03,427
I think in all
the excitement earlier

606
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,093
I got a little heated

607
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:06,693
and I didn't mean
to take it out on you.

608
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:09,327
Kid, I got thicker
skin than that.

609
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,727
It'll be a hell of
a sorry day when I let some

610
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,327
sweet faced, do‐gooder
baby doc get to me.

611
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,493
Right. So you're
feeling better?

612
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,227
Feeling great.

613
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,760
Going to have a nice, big
scar to show the judge

614
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:21,227
when I take these freeloading
bastards to court.

615
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,360
‐ 'How's Avery doing?'
‐ Taking him up to the OR.

616
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:30,260
But he's doing much better.
They embolized the bleeders

617
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:31,560
and his pressure's
up to 120.

618
00:24:31,593 --> 00:24:33,193
‐ What about his spine?
‐ No lumbar fractures.

619
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:34,560
He started moving his legs
in radiology.

620
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:35,827
‐ So he's going to make it?
‐ Oh, yeah.

621
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,527
He'll be up and around
in a couple of months.

622
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,427
‐ Thank God. Excellent.
‐ Nice work, Carter.

623
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,060
We needed a good
outcome on this one.

624
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:43,193
Dr. Greene?
Carol is looking for you.

625
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:44,593
Alright.

626
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:46,760
Why did you
even try that?

627
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:49,327
When you're my size,
it's kind of expected.

628
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,627
You like signing
autographs, huh?

629
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,360
Yeah. Don't hurt
anybody's feelings.

630
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:54,527
Keep everyone happy.

631
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,460
Even if it doesn't
make you happy?

632
00:24:56,493 --> 00:24:57,693
Never thought
about it.

633
00:24:57,727 --> 00:24:59,393
Growing up,
I was the big guy.

634
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,460
Coaches wanted me to play
football and wrestle.

635
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,360
Friends asked me
to help them move.

636
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,293
I can't tell you how many times
I played Santa Claus.

637
00:25:06,427 --> 00:25:07,727
So, you do.

638
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,027
‐ Has he said anything?
‐ Nothing.

639
00:25:14,093 --> 00:25:15,260
Sheriff said
he hasn't spoken

640
00:25:15,293 --> 00:25:18,293
since his first
day in jail.

641
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,027
‐ Can you undo that, please?
‐ 'Sure.'

642
00:25:20,793 --> 00:25:23,460
'Hi, Mobalage.'

643
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:24,793
How you doing?

644
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,319
Listen, you're dehydrated

645
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:31,953
and we need your permission
to give you intravenous fluids.

646
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:33,353
Do you have
any objections?

647
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:40,253
Has anyone filled you
in on Kubby?

648
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:50,919
She's upstairs
in the intensive care unit.

649
00:25:50,953 --> 00:25:54,986
The surgery went well,
but she's in a coma.

650
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,686
However, there's
a very good chance

651
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,153
that she'll wake up.

652
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:00,686
You're gonna feel
a little needle stick now.

653
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:03,786
'I've seen how much you
love your wife, Mobalage.'

654
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:05,919
I know you didn't
intend to hurt her.

655
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:08,753
'I believe that your response
was out of your control.'

656
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,253
All we want to do
is help you.

657
00:26:14,353 --> 00:26:15,819
Do you understand?

658
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:22,853
'My father didn't
want me to get you.'

659
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,286
'My grandmother woke up,
but she's very confused.'

660
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,319
The fact that she's
conscious is a good sign.

661
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,219
she doesn't even remember
coming to the hospital.

662
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:33,953
Well, there's been
some memory loss.

663
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,153
Tell her she had a seizure.

664
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:36,886
I want another doctor.

665
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:42,286
Mr. Fong..

666
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,686
...I'm just trying
to help your mother.

667
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,219
All I'm asking you to do

668
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,986
is to tell her
that she had a seizure.

669
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,686
She wants to know why.

670
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,853
What you've experienced
is fairly common

671
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,719
so you don't need
to worry.

672
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,253
You had a seizure because

673
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,053
you have a condition
called epilepsy..

674
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:19,353
...but you're
going to be fine.

675
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,986
Thank you, doctor.

676
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:31,086
ER.

677
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,419
Jeanie, you got a call
on line three. Some pharmacy.

678
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:34,986
‐ Okay.
‐ Hi.

679
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,719
Thanks. Hi.

680
00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:38,286
How can it be
this cold in March?

681
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,219
Yeah.
I've got a phone call.

682
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,186
Oh, that's okay. I'm just
doing a report on a DUI

683
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:43,419
I brought in earlier.
I'll catch you later.

684
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,953
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

685
00:27:44,986 --> 00:27:46,953
This is Jeanie Boulet.

686
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,286
Yeah, it was a prescription
for, uh, Debbie Anderson.

687
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,786
She was in here earlier
with a hand laceration.

688
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:55,353
No. It's for
four tablets, not 40.

689
00:27:57,186 --> 00:27:59,419
Can you fax it over?

690
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,819
Okay. Just send her back here.
We'll take care of it.

691
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,686
Thank you.

692
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,119
Randi, let me know
when a fax comes in

693
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:07,186
from Blue Hills Pharmacy.

694
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,186
Elizabeth, I was just about
to try calling you.

695
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:11,019
‐ About Kubby Ekabo?
‐ How'd you know?

696
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:12,753
I heard her
husband came in.

697
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:14,253
She's had some
spontaneous eye opening.

698
00:28:14,286 --> 00:28:16,953
‐ That is a good sign.
‐ Yep. How's he doing?

699
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,353
Let's just say
I don't feel so bad

700
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,453
having insomnia
and headaches.

701
00:28:19,486 --> 00:28:21,319
You're having
headaches?

702
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:23,853
You know, I thought of another
reason you'd be having those.

703
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:26,286
‐ Mark's trying to cure me.
‐ Carbon monoxide poisoning.

704
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,019
‐ You have an old house?
‐ Yes, she does.

705
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:30,086
‐ Maybe a faulty furnace.
‐ Not venting the exhaust.

706
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,886
‐ You wake up with them?
‐ Yes, she does.

707
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,219
Could be that, then.

708
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,253
We...we should get
a carboxyhemoglobin.

709
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,053
‐ Who's on for trauma?
‐ I am.

710
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:39,886
‐ If you need me.
‐ 12‐year‐old, ten‐foot fall.

711
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,886
‐ Five minutes out.
‐ I'm going to need you.

712
00:28:45,453 --> 00:28:47,719
Excuse me? Sir?

713
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,053
Excuse me.

714
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:50,719
I, I'm going to have
to ask you

715
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:52,919
to leave
Mr. Kornberg alone.

716
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:54,786
I am Mr. Kornberg.

717
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:57,186
‐ Senior.
‐ Hey, doc, this is my dad.

718
00:28:57,219 --> 00:28:58,953
‐ How do you do?
‐ How do you do?

719
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,919
And his biggest fan.

720
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:04,019
Thank you, doctor for taking
wonderful care of my boy

721
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,353
except we'll want his trainer
to look at that hand.

722
00:29:06,386 --> 00:29:08,053
Dad, really, I'm fine.

723
00:29:08,086 --> 00:29:10,053
You know, I'm so sorry
about what happened.

724
00:29:10,086 --> 00:29:13,319
Nonsense.
My son performed a mitzvah.

725
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:16,353
Uh, an act of virtue.

726
00:29:16,386 --> 00:29:19,386
You wouldn't believe what a
publicist can do with that.

727
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,153
Uh, by the way, do you
have, uh, a children's ward?

728
00:29:23,186 --> 00:29:24,386
'Yes. Upstairs.'

729
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,953
Good. We're going.

730
00:29:26,986 --> 00:29:29,353
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Visit the sick kids.

731
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:32,086
No. I'm sorry, he needs,
he needs to rest.

732
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,819
He can't shake hands with
a few unfortunate children?

733
00:29:34,853 --> 00:29:36,986
Bring a little joy
into their lives?

734
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:39,419
For millions,
my son is a hero.

735
00:29:41,986 --> 00:29:44,119
Marci Canchola. Fell from
a second story balcony

736
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:47,019
right onto a wrought iron fence.
Fire department cut it away.

737
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,286
She's got good vitals,
but no room to intubate.

738
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:52,119
Okay, everybody,
let's do this nice and gentle.

739
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,919
Ready, and go.

740
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,353
I need suction.

741
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:58,419
Don't worry, Marci, we're going
to take good care of you.

742
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:00,386
Parents are on the way,
in hysterics.

743
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,453
Okay, I need
a full trauma panel.

744
00:30:02,486 --> 00:30:04,453
Type and cross for four.

745
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:06,019
I can't get
a laryngoscope in here.

746
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:07,719
There's no room for a crike.

747
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:10,719
Get a fiber optic scope
and a number six ET tube.

748
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:13,253
‐ Pulse ox is 92.
‐ Oxygen up to 15 liters.

749
00:30:13,286 --> 00:30:16,086
BP's 100 palp.
Pulse 120.

750
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:19,053
Okay.
High on the suction.

751
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,886
Pulse ox down to 87.
Hurry up, Mark.

752
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,086
Uh, I can't see.

753
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,686
No, I can't see a thing.
There's too much blood.

754
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:28,153
I'll be right back.
Prep the neck.

755
00:30:42,353 --> 00:30:44,019
I need suction.
I can't see the cords.

756
00:30:44,053 --> 00:30:45,086
'Pulse ox is still falling.'

757
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,919
'BP's down to 70 palp.'

758
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:49,053
I've got a pediatric needle
crike kit. Doug ordered them.

759
00:30:49,086 --> 00:30:51,086
‐ Bar's in the way.
‐ Try and get the needle in.

760
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:53,919
'She's throwing PVCs.
Pulse ox is 85.'

761
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:57,719
Aspirate air. Make sure
you're in the trachea.

762
00:30:57,753 --> 00:31:00,186
Now it's just the Seldinger
technique with a guide wire.

763
00:31:00,219 --> 00:31:02,419
Okay.

764
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:04,019
‐ Tube, please?
‐ Right here.

765
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,419
Get ready to bag her.

766
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:09,953
Okay..

767
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:11,319
...that's pretty nifty.

768
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:17,086
‐ Good breath sounds.
‐ Pulse ox is up to 89.

769
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,153
Dr. Corday,
they need you in the sicu.

770
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:20,153
Okay, we can take it
from here.

771
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:23,753
Okay.

772
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:25,986
Good thing those supplies
came in today, huh?

773
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,086
Yeah. Looks like Doug
just saved another kid.

774
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,053
Actually, Carol,
I'd say you did.

775
00:31:33,953 --> 00:31:35,153
You want me
to arrest her?

776
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,886
Well, she forged
the prescription.

777
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,453
Changed "four" to "40,"
F‐O‐U‐R‐T‐Y.

778
00:31:39,486 --> 00:31:41,453
That's fraud,
violation of DEA laws.

779
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,253
Okay, okay. If I arrest her
you're gonna have to come down

780
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:45,053
to the station
and file a report..

781
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,219
...spend two days in court
waiting to testify..

782
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,086
...then watch the judge
throw the case out of court

783
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,353
because it's probably
a first offense.

784
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,353
‐ Great. Arrest her.
‐ My advice?

785
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:53,386
Write a new
script for five pills.

786
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:54,986
She can't change
that to "50"

787
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,853
she's happy, and you
can have lunch with me.

788
00:31:56,886 --> 00:31:58,686
I can't have
lunch with you.

789
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:01,319
‐ Then dinner.
‐ I can't.

790
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,119
You're not going to take
this out on me, are you?

791
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,286
No, Reggie. It's just..

792
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,953
..you know, I need
to tell you something.

793
00:32:06,986 --> 00:32:10,019
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

794
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,719
No time like the present.

795
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,153
I'm seeing someone else.

796
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,919
I thought we had
something going here.

797
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:19,819
I know, and I'm sorry.

798
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,853
It's just...it just
isn't going to work out.

799
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:24,086
I need to get back
to work.

800
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,786
Can we at least talk
about this later?

801
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,253
I don't think so.

802
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,153
I'm going to call you.

803
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:31,686
'County, this is Zadro
of rescue 47.'

804
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:33,053
'My partner's been shot.'

805
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,119
47, what are the vital signs?

806
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,753
'I can't get them.
It's bad. He's unconscious.'

807
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,419
Hey, Zadro, this is Carter.
What happened?

808
00:32:39,453 --> 00:32:41,386
'We got ambushed.
They shot Lars.'

809
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,353
Shot him? Shot him where?
Where are his wounds?

810
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,219
'I can't tell.
There's blood everywhere.'

811
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:47,219
Alright, well,
just get here, get here.

812
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:52,219
Lungs sound good.

813
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:55,686
Hi, Kubby.

814
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,986
How you feeling?

815
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,786
Dr. Greene.

816
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:00,419
Where is my husband?

817
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:04,719
Kubby, you were stabbed
and you've been in a coma.

818
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:07,386
I don't think Mobalage
intended to hurt you.

819
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,953
He wasn't himself.

820
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,886
Oh, God!

821
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,219
Mobalage.

822
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:16,453
That is not true.

823
00:33:16,486 --> 00:33:18,286
I think your husband
suffers from what's known

824
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,819
as post‐traumatic stress.

825
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:22,753
No. He did not hurt me.

826
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:26,319
What do you mean?

827
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:28,653
I wan...I wanted to die.

828
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:31,953
I was so ashamed..

829
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:35,186
...I, I took the knife..

830
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,219
...I did this.

831
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:50,719
Oh, God.

832
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,419
Give me a C‐collar.

833
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:58,253
Looks like head,
neck, chest.

834
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,886
‐ I got a faint pulse.
‐ 'Ready with the backboard.'

835
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,119
Hang on. Hang on.

836
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:03,419
Okay, slide it in.

837
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:06,853
'How's his airway?'

838
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:08,119
Shallow arrest.
Get ready to bag, Connie.

839
00:34:08,153 --> 00:34:10,353
‐ Okay, let's move!
‐ Alright, very careful.

840
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,719
Chest tube's in. Let's go with
the thoraseal.

841
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:17,975
‐ What's his pressure?
‐ 80 palp.

842
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,709
‐ What about the thoraseal?
‐ Wait a second.

843
00:34:19,742 --> 00:34:22,042
I've got the subclavian.
Let's hang the type specific.

844
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:23,642
Set up another
central line on the left.

845
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:25,009
‐ I've already got one.
‐ We should have two.

846
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,075
‐ One is enough.
‐ What if it infiltrates?

847
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,325
It's not going to happen.

848
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:31,525
Even if it does we've got two
large‐bore antecubitals.

849
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,292
‐ Are you alright?
‐ How's he doing?

850
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:34,325
I'll take it
from here, Carter.

851
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:35,925
Getting ready
to go to the OR.

852
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,159
Came around the corner,
there they were

853
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:38,425
just waiting for us.

854
00:34:38,459 --> 00:34:40,225
‐ Was Lars driving?
‐ I don't know.

855
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:42,059
It went down so fast, I couldn't
even tell what was happening.

856
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:44,092
Dwight, was Lars driving?

857
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,425
‐ Yeah.
‐ They were shooting for me.

858
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,392
I was driving last night.
They wanted me.

859
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,925
Mr. Kornberg..

860
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:58,992
...You were looking for me?

861
00:34:59,025 --> 00:35:01,592
I just wanted to say thank you.
We're going to be leaving now

862
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:03,925
as soon as my dad gets
done with that photographer.

863
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,959
'Oh, photos from
the pediatrics ward, huh?'

864
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:08,559
Yeah. Nurses handed
out these balloons.

865
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:10,325
Little boy
insisted I have his.

866
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,125
You can't get away
from it, can you?

867
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,359
The kids all seem
to know who I am.

868
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:14,925
Their faces light up.

869
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:16,459
Plus, it makes
my dad proud.

870
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:19,159
You know
how parents can be.

871
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:20,425
‐ Thanks again, doc.
‐ Okay.

872
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:22,392
‐ Take care.
‐ You're welcome.

873
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:24,225
'I want to go in.'

874
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,059
'Let us do our work.
We'll explore the chest'

875
00:35:26,092 --> 00:35:28,125
'stop the bleeding
then call the neurosurgeon..'

876
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,925
Let me know
what's going on.

877
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:31,559
I'm gonna be with him the whole
time. but you better stay here.

878
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,892
‐ Carter, what are you doing?
‐ Scrubbing in.

879
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,625
Aren't you
on duty in the ER?

880
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:40,292
No. I worked last night.

881
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:42,592
That was the ride‐along
with this fella, right?

882
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,192
That's right.

883
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,425
Carter, I don't think
there's enough room.

884
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,159
What do you mean?

885
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,259
We've got general surgery,
neurosurgery and thoracic

886
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,425
all working together.

887
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:52,159
I'll scrub out if I have to.

888
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,892
'We appreciate
your concern, doctor'

889
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,992
but it might be best

890
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:57,892
if you watch from
the observation gallery.

891
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,459
Feeling better?

892
00:36:07,492 --> 00:36:08,992
The fluids should help.

893
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:16,425
I talked to Kubby.

894
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,525
'She woke up, and she's doing
much better.'

895
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:23,392
She also told me
that you didn't hurt her.

896
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:33,992
When the paramedics
showed up..

897
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,625
...the flashing lights
and the sirens..

898
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,525
...the pounding
on the door..

899
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:40,159
...they must
have scared you.

900
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:42,892
Yes.

901
00:36:46,992 --> 00:36:48,359
Is that why you ran away?

902
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,592
Why didn't you
tell the police?

903
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,459
'Why did you say
it was your fault?'

904
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:59,625
It was my fault,
what happened to her.

905
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:03,325
When I left Nigeria

906
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,392
the soldiers came,
and they raped her..

907
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,025
...because of me.

908
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:13,492
I had left her alone.

909
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:17,292
When she told me..

910
00:37:17,325 --> 00:37:18,859
...I couldn't
look at her.

911
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:22,059
I couldn't talk to her.

912
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:28,492
She was alone again,
and that's when she took the..

913
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,959
...she took the knife.

914
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,059
She needed me..

915
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:45,025
...but I had left her.

916
00:37:48,392 --> 00:37:50,092
She needs you now.

917
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,325
I need more suction.

918
00:37:58,359 --> 00:37:59,625
2‐0 vicryl.

919
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:01,892
Okay. He's oozing
all over the place.

920
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,892
Shirley, give me some FFP
and platelets, now!

921
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,292
Hey, what's going
on in there?

922
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:09,359
What are they doing?

923
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:10,392
I'm going
to the blood bank.

924
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:11,559
Are they using
the cell saver?

925
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,992
‐ Yes.
‐ Have they called neurosurgery?

926
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:14,525
I don't know, Carter.
I need to get blood.

927
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,092
Should we set up for bypass?

928
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,925
Not necessary.

929
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:26,659
'There are no
intercardiac injuries.'

930
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:28,292
Vascular clamp.

931
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:29,492
Have you called
neurosurgery yet?

932
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,225
We will, Carter.
We will.

933
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:41,092
Yeah, hi. I need neurosurgery
to OR three, please.

934
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,325
OR Three.

935
00:38:56,325 --> 00:38:57,492
'We took her statement.'

936
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,392
'DA agreed to drop
the charges.'

937
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:03,159
‐ I wish it was all good news.
‐ What's up?

938
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:05,425
Immigration service
contacted the department.

939
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:06,925
It turns out Mr. Ekabo

940
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,892
came into the country
on a forged visa.

941
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:11,059
‐ What does that mean?
‐ He's an illegal.

942
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:12,892
Don't tell me you'll
take him back to jail.

943
00:39:12,925 --> 00:39:15,025
No, but the INS will start
a deportation hearing.

944
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:17,092
To send him
back to Nigeria?

945
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,325
That's the way it works.

946
00:39:29,425 --> 00:39:31,059
Hey, are you
from neurosurgery?

947
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:32,559
No. Radiology.
I got the CTs

948
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,092
I'll take these.

949
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:41,592
Uh, films show bullet fragments
in the right parietal lobe.

950
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:45,392
Neck wound‐‐ shattered c4.

951
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,192
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

952
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,992
I didn't know whether
you'd be able to read them.

953
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:51,025
‐ Neurosurgery wants the films.
‐ What did they say?

954
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,959
They said they were
called in too soon.

955
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:56,925
V‐fib. Starting
internal compressions.

956
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:58,959
Give me the paddles.
Let's move. Charge to 15.

957
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,192
Come on people, let's move.

958
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:02,992
Heart's empty.
He needs volume.

959
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,325
Okay, here we go. Clear!

960
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:09,159
Okay. Let's go again.
Charge to 30.

961
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:11,159
'Clear.'

962
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:12,925
'Okay. Charge again.
Clear.'

963
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:17,192
‐ Hey, Jeanie.
‐ Hey.

964
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:18,425
What are you doing?

965
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,559
Just checking out
some old charts.

966
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:22,425
Looking for
anything specific?

967
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:24,392
Yeah. I talked
to Al today.

968
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:26,492
He tested negative
for hepatitis "C."

969
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,559
he even faxed me
his results.

970
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,092
Which means I probably got it
from a patient.

971
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:34,292
We're all so worried;
me working here with HIV‐‐

972
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,092
the chance of me
infecting someone.

973
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,092
Never even thought
about a patient infecting me.

974
00:40:40,737 --> 00:40:43,370
But it could have happened
to any one of us, right?

975
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,303
Yeah.

976
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:48,737
Hey, Jeanie,
do you want to..

977
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,370
...want to go get a cup
of coffee, or something?

978
00:40:51,403 --> 00:40:53,037
No, thanks.
I'm going to stay here.

979
00:40:53,637 --> 00:40:55,003
Okay.

980
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:56,503
‐ I'll see you tomorrow.
‐ Okay, Kerry.

981
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,437
'Carol?'

982
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,970
What are you doing?

983
00:41:11,003 --> 00:41:12,703
Oh, unloading these boxes.

984
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:15,070
Doug ordered a lot
of supplies.

985
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:16,570
Have you spoken
with him?

986
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:20,070
Thought about it
a lot last night.

987
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:23,237
I ended up calling
the home shopping network

988
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:25,237
and ordered myself
a pair of fleece booties.

989
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:31,170
So, uh, did Mark manage
to strap you down..

990
00:41:31,203 --> 00:41:32,270
...get a blood gas?

991
00:41:32,303 --> 00:41:34,337
Finally talked me into it.

992
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,970
It's easier doing that
than listening to him.

993
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:40,537
My carbon monoxide level
was normal.

994
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,103
Oh, well. It was
a good guess.

995
00:41:43,137 --> 00:41:45,070
Mark's just trying
to be a friend in that

996
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,270
endearing‐slightly‐inept‐male
kind of way.

997
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:50,437
I know.

998
00:41:52,203 --> 00:41:53,603
I'm a week late.

999
00:41:55,537 --> 00:41:57,670
You're what?

1000
00:41:57,703 --> 00:42:00,737
At first, I thought
it was just stress.

1001
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,303
But it's not.

1002
00:42:05,337 --> 00:42:06,703
I'm pregnant.

1003
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,270
Yeah.

1004
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:36,203
That was a..

1005
00:42:36,237 --> 00:42:37,537
...it was a good effort.

1006
00:42:38,437 --> 00:42:39,570
Yeah.

1007
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,503
Thank you, everyone.

1008
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:48,270
Carter, let's go.

1009
00:42:48,303 --> 00:42:50,037
I'm just going to
stay for a second.
