1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,166
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,100
That was a great save.

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:12,333
Actually, I meant being
your full‐time P. A.

4
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:14,266
Great. I'd love that.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,800
This is more of a formality
than anything else.

6
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,033
Maybe for you, but you're
the only intern I have.

7
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,500
I admire your fortitude.

8
00:00:20,533 --> 00:00:22,666
I couldn't handle taking orders
from a weasel like Dale.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,633
Your presentation
was everything we expected.

10
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,233
This is ridiculous, Lucy.
Everyone thinks you can.

11
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,500
I know. I'm going to talk
to Dr. Carter.

12
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,600
I haven't started an IV.

13
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,366
I don't know how.
I never have.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,733
If you ever lie
to me again

15
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,266
you can look
for another rotation.

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,200
Aah! Sorry.

17
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,333
'She's in active labor.'

18
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,133
Water broke
in the rig.

19
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,566
Probably got
to play catch.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,500
Hey, Jerry, scarfing a little
early dinner back there?

21
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,033
What?

22
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,633
Oh, no. Good one, Chuny.

23
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,800
‐ Baby, baby, baby.
‐ This our mother‐to‐be?

24
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,666
Ah, good guess.
First name's Coco.

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
No last name, no address.
Collapsed in a crosswalk.

26
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,333
‐ Walk, don't walk, don't talk.
‐ Her vitals are stable.

27
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:16,733
‐ Ooh, I can feel the head.
‐ Started a line

28
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,800
We took a peek down south,
she's not crowning.

29
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,033
Crown me, I'm the queen,
and the prince is coming.

30
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,100
♪ Coming 'round
the mountain..♪

31
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:23,200
When's your due date, Coco?

32
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:25,600
I don't like dates.
Too sweet. Oh!

33
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:27,300
Big one.
Big pain.

34
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,533
Oh...oh.

35
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,100
Have you delivered
a baby before?

36
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,166
No delivery.

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,533
Let's go
to curtain area three.

38
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,266
BOA Kit, fetal monitor.

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,100
‐ Baby warmer.
‐ Take it out!

40
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,766
‐ Hey, Jerry, page OB for me.
‐ You got it.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,100
Dude, the eagle has landed.

42
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,200
Oh, Lydia, I‐I guess
you didn't get my memo.

43
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:47,033
The PM shift is not wearing
costumes this year.

44
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,633
It scares the patients.

45
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,266
A lot of things have been said
over the years

46
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,633
about this set of gams,
but "scary" isn't one of them.

47
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,533
Well, you know, it also
isn't very professional

48
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:56,200
so if you wouldn't
mind changing

49
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,733
I‐I actually got some of these
little Jack‐O‐Lantern pins

50
00:01:59,766 --> 00:02:02,066
for those who want
to signify the holiday.

51
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,366
Fun.

52
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,566
I'm glad my no‐costume memo
made it to some people.

53
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,466
This is my costume.
I'm dressed as a total stiff.

54
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh.

55
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:14,800
I guess I can make
an exception.

56
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:17,133
Four‐year‐old child with severe
puncture wounds to the neck.

57
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,566
Why isn't this kid
in the trauma room?

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
You said you wanted to see
all the children in..

59
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,100
I need an intubation tray now,
alright?

60
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,200
And I want four units
of your blood.

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,033
Oh, come on.
This is funny.

62
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,066
You of all people
should be able to take a joke.

63
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,666
I just didn't think it was
appropriate, that's all.

64
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,366
But putting surgilube
all over every phone

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
in the ER,
that's‐that's okay?

66
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,433
No, no, but I wasn't in charge
of the whole ER.

67
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:33,100
I am in charge
of the Pedes ER.

68
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,666
Well, the joke was on you, Doug,
not on the Pedes ER.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,233
But that seems to be one
and the same these days.

70
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,800
What's that supposed to mean?

71
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,200
The memo.

72
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:43,066
‐ I got in my box this morning.
‐ Yeah?

73
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,566
I thought it was
your Halloween prank.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,633
Why, why? What's wrong
with this? What?

75
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,433
Doug, "All pediatric patients

76
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:51,266
"must be seen by Dr. Ross
prior to discharge.

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
"Dr. Ross will conduct
a daily review

78
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,566
on all pediatric patients."

79
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,300
Right. What's
wrong with that?

80
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,566
Means you have to sign off
on Kerry Weaver's charts.

81
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,533
‐ Well, yeah, and Mark.
‐ Yeah, so you're psyched

82
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,100
Well, it's time
for a change, that's all.

83
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:04,233
Yeah, kind of like me,
I woke up this morning

84
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,533
and I was a Transylvanian bat.

85
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,533
‐ Alright, enough, okay?
‐ Good luck.

86
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:09,066
'Carol, could you come
in here?'

87
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,233
What's up?

88
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:16,600
Coco here claims to be
nine months pregnant.

89
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,233
Try for fetal
heart tones.

90
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,300
I couldn't find them.

91
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,200
Find 'em.
Don't lose 'em.

92
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,166
Look in the,
look in the lost and found.

93
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,566
'Look in the..'

94
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,433
Cervix isn't dilated.

95
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,100
No adnexal masses.

96
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,200
She sure looks pregnant.

97
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,400
Duh, I'm having a baby.

98
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,200
All I can appreciate
is a normal uterus

99
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:35,733
and about two liters
of urine in her bladder.

100
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:38,066
Coco, we're going
to give you a bedpan.

101
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,800
Can you try and relax
and relieve yourself?

102
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,000
Shallow breath.

103
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,666
Nature's way.

104
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,033
‐ 'Want me to get a Foley?'
‐ Yeah.

105
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:49,533
And a urine tox screen.

106
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,100
Call psych while
you're at it.

107
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,200
I can't believe you're
gonna wear that all day.

108
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,766
It has gotten itchy,
but it's my first

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Halloween in the States.

110
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,666
What do you mean?
You were here last year.

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah, but I was stuck
in the OR all night.

112
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,466
So no trick‐or‐treating,
apple bobbing, hayrides..

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,800
‐ Hayrides?
‐ Yeah.

114
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,233
Isn't that how you
celebrate Halloween

115
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,500
riding in a cart
full of hay

116
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:09,433
with your sweetie
under the stars?

117
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,133
Elizabeth, there are
no hay carts in Chicago.

118
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:15,100
You know what I mean. It's all
about celebrating the night.

119
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,200
Celebrating what, huh?

120
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,433
Kids rotting their teeth out

121
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:18,466
getting sick to their stomach

122
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,733
people wearing these stupid..

123
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,700
Well, I have a thing
against costumes, you know?

124
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:27,100
There must've been someone
you wanted to be.

125
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm a doctor.
That's who I wanted to be.

126
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,533
Yes, but as a child.

127
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:35,400
You must've wanted to be
a spaceman, or a footballer.

128
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:37,366
Nope.

129
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,033
You really are
extraordinary, Peter.

130
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,766
How about a knight
in shining armor?

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,433
‐ No.
‐ A cowboy.

132
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,533
No, listen, if you
wanna celebrate

133
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:49,033
why don't we go
to Dempsey's?

134
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:50,800
They got great food
and‐and, uh, what is that?

135
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,033
Uh. Swing dancing.

136
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,366
Elizabeth,
there you are.

137
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,466
My sigmoid volvulus
is red‐lined to the OR.

138
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,200
And the pre‐op labs
aren't on the chart.

139
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,433
Well, I just checked
the computer.

140
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,133
Everything's back
except the electrolytes.

141
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,700
Checking the computer
isn't good enough.

142
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,366
I just called the lab
and the specimen was hemolyzed.

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,300
‐ I'll call phlebotomy.
‐ Takes too long.

144
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,600
I want you
to redraw yourself

145
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,233
and hand‐carry
it to the lab.

146
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,766
Yes, sir.

147
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:19,700
‐ Excuse me.
‐ Just a minute.

148
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:22,700
‐ Yeah?
‐ I'm looking for Dr. Greene.

149
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:24,066
Oh, damn!

150
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,533
I needed
to save that.

151
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,433
So I can find
Dr. Greene where?

152
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,700
Yeah, you're gonna have to wait
in chairs.

153
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,100
Okeydoke.

154
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:36,066
Jerry, has the systems guy
taken a look at this yet?

155
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,533
Na, he looked,
but he didn't touch.

156
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,166
The work order wasn't co‐signed.

157
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,166
Lily, what do
you got there?

158
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,066
This was just sitting
out in the ambulance bay.

159
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,766
Look, there's all kinds of stuff
in this bag, too.

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,766
Four by fours,
steri‐strips, IV tubing.

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,566
Yeah, you know what?
I'll take care of this.

162
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,533
‐ Really? You sure?
‐ Yeah. No worries.

163
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:54,066
‐ Thanks.
‐ Sure.

164
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,666
‐ Hey, Jerry.
‐ Hi.

165
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,133
So you can't blow it off?

166
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:00,233
Oh, don't get me wrong.

167
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,666
I would love
to attend your shindig

168
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,800
but this
is a teamster party.

169
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,200
Ah‐ha, your eyes are aglow
with the fire.

170
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,600
of disability policies

171
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,700
Well, it's rare
that a policy underwriter

172
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,666
has an opportunity
at a whole room

173
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,533
full of drunken
manual laborers.

174
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,233
Sounds better
than chaperoning a dorm party.

175
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,666
Everybody knows the best part
of a bad party is sneaking out

176
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,566
preferably not alone.

177
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,466
So I might
see you later.

178
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,666
Or I'll make
it up to you.

179
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,633
Dr. Carter, hi.

180
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,733
Um, I got the elbow films
back on Mr‐‐

181
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,600
Lucy, can you give
us a second, please?

182
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,666
Sure.

183
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,166
What? What are you saying?

184
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,433
I got the elbow films back
on Mr. Cahan

185
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:42,300
and the CBC
and chem panel on his nicolora.

186
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,366
Thanks. Looks good.

187
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,666
Yeah, I was thinking
about you at dinner

188
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,466
and I realized
that I left this in my car.

189
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,566
Is that for the party?

190
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,666
No, I think that you should

191
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,333
start practicing your IV's.

192
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:53,700
I have been practicing.

193
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,400
Well, then this should
be old hat for you.

194
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,800
‐ Dr. Carter, good.
‐ Hey..

195
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,033
Those suckers are heavy.

196
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,133
What are these?

197
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,700
Tomorrow's departmental
conference

198
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,433
"The acute abdomen
in the elderly."

199
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:06,200
I pulled an ischemic bowel
you had a few months ago.

200
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,566
I was hoping
that you could present.

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,066
I've never done that.

202
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,366
Well, it's great experience
if you're serious

203
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,800
about becoming chief resident.

204
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,200
‐ Oh, I'm serious.
‐ Okay.

205
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,233
I look forward
to your presentation.

206
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:18,133
Chief resident.
Pretty cool.

207
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,733
Yeah. I'm pretty cool.

208
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,066
‐ 'Incoming.'
‐ I got it.

209
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,666
‐ What do we got?
‐ Joe Chattarowski, 40.

210
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Was drinking a quart of vodka
in front of Lucky Liquor.

211
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,433
Called 911 when he was
too drunk to walk.

212
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,300
‐ I need help, doc.
‐ Exam two.

213
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,200
Do you drink every day,
Mr. Chattarowski?

214
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:35,133
Yeah. But I wanna quit.

215
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,800
‐ Are you serious?
‐ I'm dead serious.

216
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,800
You're not just looking
for a place to sleep it off?

217
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,600
'On my mother's eyes.'

218
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:45,200
Can you admit me
for detox, please?

219
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,666
‐ Dr. Carter?
‐ Oh..

220
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,600
I think Miss Knight
can help you out with that.

221
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,033
Why don't you see if you can
find him a detox bed.

222
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:52,600
Then you can practice
on that teaching arm.

223
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,266
Alright, let's transfer him.
Ready? One, two, three.

224
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,666
Average daily
census is 150.

225
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,133
‐ We see 275 a day at Bellevue.
‐ Impressive.

226
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,700
We're the second‐largest
emergency department

227
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,633
in the world.

228
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll show you
the trauma rooms.

229
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,533
Psst. Hey, Jerry.

230
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,066
‐ Hmm.
‐ Who's that?

231
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,166
‐ With Dr. Greene?
‐ Yeah.

232
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
That is Dr. Litvak
from New York.

233
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:17,500
The Dan Litvak?

234
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,800
Yeah. I think he's here
interviewing to be ER chief.

235
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,266
Oh, my God.

236
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,200
Dan Litvak,
he's national chair

237
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:25,433
of the ACEP panel

238
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,800
for practice guidelines.

239
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,566
Lead article
in last month's annals.

240
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
Well, that's good, right?

241
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:37,066
Hey, buddy. I'm Dr. Ross.

242
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,566
‐ What's your name?
‐ Jared.

243
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,566
Pruritic rash right after
putting on his Halloween makeup.

244
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,633
‐ He's covered with hives.
‐ Mmm‐hmm.

245
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,400
Let's take a look at him.
Has he had hives before?

246
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,066
‐ No.
‐ Alright.

247
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,633
Now, any, uh, swelling
in your mouth?

248
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,400
Are you having
trouble breathing?

249
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,366
‐ My tongue feels big.
‐ Okay.

250
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,333
BP's 90 over 60, pulse 72.

251
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:55,800
Okay, let's give him .2

252
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,333
of sub‐Q epi, Benadryl 25 IV.

253
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,700
Is he going to be okay?

254
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,266
He has a bad
allergic reaction.

255
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,733
'We need to treat him
with IV medication'

256
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,166
and just watch him
for a few hours.

257
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,666
Can I still go
trick‐or‐treating?

258
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,266
'I don't think so, sweetie.'

259
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,433
But we can find you some fun
stuff to do around here.

260
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:14,033
Fun stuff around here sucks.

261
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,366
'What did you do
with my baby?'

262
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,433
What did you..
Where's my baby?

263
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:20,566
Should I ask?

264
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,400
2200 cc's out so far.
Belly's flat.

265
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:25,633
Oh, I lost my baby.

266
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,600
Haldol, five
milligrams IM.

267
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,466
Mark, I'm looking
for your‐your chart reviews

268
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,300
on last month's
unscheduled returns.

269
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,100
Uh, yeah,
I put 'em in your box.

270
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:38,266
Kerry, this is
Dr. Dan Litvak.

271
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,400
This is Dr. Kerry Weaver,
our interim chief.

272
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:41,633
Nice to meet you.

273
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,233
Where you from, Dr. Litvak?

274
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,200
New York, Bellevue.

275
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:49,166
Just here
to get a few tips?

276
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,500
'No, I just had
my second interview'

277
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,333
'for the chief position.'

278
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:54,533
Dr. Greene is being kind enough
to show me around.

279
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,500
Second interview.

280
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,166
Yeah, they wanted to,
uh, meet with Dr. Litvak

281
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,066
one more time
before tonight's vote.

282
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,066
Yeah, I thought the vote
wasn't until next Wednesday.

283
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,333
'I have to hop a plane'

284
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:06,400
'to a conference
in Bermuda tonight.'

285
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:07,433
They thought it would be best

286
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,733
if I could know beforehand.

287
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,533
Well, that's great.
The sooner the better, huh?

288
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:13,500
I guess, I'll just
check my mailbox.

289
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,700
That's the competition, huh?

290
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,800
Did you have any luck
with that detox bed?

291
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,666
No one called me back yet.

292
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,566
Got a flash...and I am in.

293
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,100
Yes, you are.

294
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,366
I think I'm ready
for the real thing now.

295
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,566
Well, let's find out.

296
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,433
I'll talk you through
Mr. Chattarowski.

297
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,466
Okay.

298
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,533
Make sure we don't repeat

299
00:11:36,566 --> 00:11:37,800
our last IV fiasco.

300
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,666
That definitely
won't happen again.

301
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,633
No. It was my fault
as much as it was yours.

302
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,333
Oh, I wouldn't
exactly say that.

303
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,200
Well, I should've supervised
you a little bit more closely.

304
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,566
Should never have let you get
to the place that you did.

305
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
From now on,
we'll just take it

306
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,100
one step at a time.

307
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,533
Carter, your drunk eloped.

308
00:11:53,566 --> 00:11:55,533
‐ Chattarowski?
‐ Does that mean he left?

309
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,666
‐ Yep.
‐ Does anyone else need an IV?

310
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,100
I've got it.

311
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,566
You wanted to
be a superhero.

312
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,066
Tights, cape..

313
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:06,800
‐ Yeah, wrong.
‐ Well, there was someone.

314
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,366
Wasn't there?

315
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
Hey, look
who's here.

316
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,400
Bye‐bye, cutie pie.

317
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,666
‐ Hey..
‐ Hey, little bee.

318
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,733
‐ Gosh, he's getting so big.
‐ I know.

319
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,533
He's eating me out
of house and home.

320
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,566
I didn't expect you.

321
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,766
We just left
Walt and Jackie's.

322
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,500
Oh, yeah.
The annual blowout?

323
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,400
Yeah, and I told Walt
that he should just put on one

324
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,033
of his super duper fly outfits
he used to wear in the '70s..

325
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,766
Nah, don't encourage him,
that brother still thinks

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,466
Polyester's gonna make a
comeback.

327
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,133
Speaking of costumes,
do you have any film

328
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,366
left in that camera?

329
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,300
Yes.

330
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,633
We should have him
with his daddy.

331
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,700
‐ Absolutely.
‐ Would you do the honors?

332
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,800
Yeah, sure.

333
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,400
Okay.

334
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,700
Ready?

335
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:45,566
Feeling any better?

336
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm alright...I guess.

337
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,200
What did you..

338
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,400
What did you give me?

339
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,766
Uh, Haldol,
to calm you down.

340
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,033
I can't take that.

341
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,366
It's not good for my baby.

342
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,733
Coco, you don't
have a baby.

343
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:10,566
But I will, really.

344
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm in my first trimester.

345
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,666
'Coco...you're not pregnant.'

346
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,233
'You were just retaining urine.'

347
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,400
Carol..

348
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,800
You did do a pregnancy test,
didn't you?

349
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,466
Starting to wish I had.

350
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,300
'Um, I'm‐I'm schizophrenic'

351
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:31,733
and...I had been
taking Risperidone

352
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,500
but when I found out
I was pregnant

353
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:36,633
I went off the medication
so that the baby would be okay.

354
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,366
What will the Haldol do
to the baby?

355
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
If in fact,
you are pregnant..

356
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:51,733
...there are reports
of limb malformation.

357
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,300
Oh, my God.

358
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,300
I'm so sorry, baby.

359
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,166
'Aorta's clamped,
pericardium's dry.'

360
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,533
Alright. Looks like
the heart is still empty.

361
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:18,300
Let's get two
more units.

362
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,400
Chest tube's gushing.
It's over two liters.

363
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:22,333
Could be a Hilar injury.
Alright, people.

364
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,633
Let's set up for a right‐sided
thoracotomy. Let's move.

365
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,633
Ten blade.
We'll do a clamshell.

366
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,433
Malik, call the blood bank,
we need more O‐neg

367
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,066
and type specific
when it's ready.

368
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,133
Okay. Rib spreader.
Peter, cut across the sternum.

369
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,466
'Alright. I need
a lebshke knife.'

370
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,733
‐ A what?
‐ A lebshke and a mallet.

371
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,133
Let's move!

372
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,733
Look. Top drawer
by the sink.

373
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,166
What you really need
is a sternal saw.

374
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,566
A sternal saw is a tool for the
OR not the ER, you know that.

375
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,766
The right chest
is full of blood.

376
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Vascular clamp. More suction.

377
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,033
'Alright, could you
locate the source?'

378
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,266
Ahh.

379
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
Alright. Move your hand,
move your hand.

380
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,733
Four units in.

381
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:56,466
Okay, come on, Peter.

382
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,366
He's losing it faster
than we can put it in.

383
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,333
‐ Damn!
‐ Type specific's here.

384
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,600
Hang two rapid infuser.

385
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,000
Alright,
I'm almost there.

386
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,100
Looks like right atrium.

387
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,466
O‐vicryl now.
Let's move. Let's move.

388
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,566
You know, there were
faster ways to do that.

389
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,300
I am pregnant.

390
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,800
The test confirmed it.

391
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,400
'We don't know if the Haldol
affected the fetus.'

392
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,233
We're going to monitor
the pregnancy with ultrasound.

393
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,366
Maybe I shouldn't
have a baby.

394
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,166
Because of the Haldol?

395
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
I didn't even tell my mom,
you know.

396
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,100
'It was like,
she‐she was so proud'

397
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:41,800
'that I was in
the Halfway house.'

398
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,300
I thought it would be okay.

399
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:48,466
I thought I could go off
my meds, but I..

400
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,333
Can't, can I?

401
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,600
You'll probably have more
incidents like this one.

402
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,166
I shouldn't go
through with this.

403
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:06,300
You've been through a lot
in a short amount of time.

404
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,233
Maybe you should just wait.

405
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,366
I shouldn't do this.

406
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,200
I shouldn't do this.

407
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,333
So you think she'll
terminate her pregnancy?

408
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,233
That's the impression I got.

409
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:24,733
Probably be the best
for her and for you.

410
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah. Gets me off the hook.

411
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,033
You wanna have a drink later?
Decompress?

412
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:32,166
I would,
but Jen's back in town

413
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,066
and we have to have
one of our talks.

414
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,366
Oh. Sounds like it's
not your day, Mark.

415
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,666
You can take off now
if you want, Lucy.

416
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,200
We're pretty caught
up around here.

417
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,433
What about the Pedes ER?

418
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,766
It's standing room only
in there.

419
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,300
Doug Ross
is in a groove, huh?

420
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,200
No. You'd probably
just slow him down.

421
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,333
Right, well, that gives
me more time

422
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:49,500
to get ready for the party.

423
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset the..

424
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,333
Found this guy right back
chillin'

425
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,333
with a bottle of night train
in front of Lucky's.

426
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,133
'You all need a revolving door
on your exam rooms.'

427
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:04,333
Well, well, well. Long time
no see, Mr. Chattarowski.

428
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:05,733
So, you know this guy?

429
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,333
Yeah. Had him in earlier.

430
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,200
He came in looking
to be detoxed

431
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,166
and then eloped before we could
get the blood work done.

432
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,633
Well, next time,
I'm just calling the cops.

433
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,300
We can take him from here, okay?

434
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,200
‐ You're off, anyway.
‐ Thanks .

435
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,500
Curtain area two.

436
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,566
Mr. Chattarowski,
I'm Dr. Greene.

437
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,133
This is Nurse Hathaway.

438
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,800
We'd like
to welcome you back.

439
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,700
I know I screwed up, doc.

440
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,133
I'm a screw up by nature.

441
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,566
I wanna make a clean start.
I really do.

442
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,666
You're not going to make a very
clean start, Mr. Chattarowski

443
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,100
with a bottle
of booze in your hand.

444
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,266
That was my last drink.

445
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,700
I'm not gonna poison myself
no more, I promise.

446
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,700
Other than bloodshot, the eyes
look okay. Lean forward.

447
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,133
I'm going to get
clean and sober, doc..

448
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,666
You gotta be quiet
so I can hear your lungs.

449
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,166
And a picket fence..

450
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,333
Shh, shh, shh! Shh, shh.

451
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,633
BP's 130 palp.

452
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,200
Mr. Chattarowski

453
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,200
I'm gonna try
and get you a detox bed

454
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,766
but you have to promise me
you're gonna stay.

455
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,766
I promise.

456
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
I really do.

457
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,666
I'm going to get clean
and sober.

458
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,666
Okay. If you could just scoot
over to this bed.

459
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,033
You think he'll stay?

460
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:19,800
Well, I was a cynic
with Ms. Coco

461
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,533
and we saw how
that worked out.

462
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,666
So karmically, I have
to believe this guy.

463
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,466
Okay, Dr. Karma,
but if you don't mind

464
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,333
I'm gonna lock up
his clothes so it makes it

465
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:30,133
a little harder for him
to escape this time.

466
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,666
Good idea.

467
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,766
Amanda, you have
to stay still for me.

468
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,766
It will only hurt
for a second.

469
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,266
No, daddy!

470
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,433
If you're good, I'll give you
some stickers when she's done.

471
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:44,700
I don't want stickers, daddy.

472
00:18:44,733 --> 00:18:48,233
‐ Is this really necessary?
‐ Yeah, unfortunately, it is.

473
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,233
We have to take blood
to do the test.

474
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,500
‐ Daddy, I wanna go home.
‐ Is everything alright in here?

475
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,733
‐ Yes, fine.
‐ Doctor.

476
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,200
My little girl's
afraid of needles.

477
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,333
Is there a way to test her
without all this?

478
00:18:58,507 --> 00:18:59,741
As a matter of
fact, there is.

479
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,407
‐ What do we got?
‐ Barbie Kligman.

480
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:02,641
11‐year‐old MVA.

481
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,574
Backseat passenger
with a lap belt.

482
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:05,907
Complains of abdominal pain.

483
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:09,607
BP 105 over 70, pulse 95.

484
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,674
Alright. Let's get
a CBC, chem 20.

485
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:13,607
Type and hold,
and dip a urine.

486
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:15,741
Barbie, does
your neck hurt?

487
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,874
No, just my stomach.

488
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,207
Hmm, pulse ox is 98
on room air.

489
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,774
‐ Chest is clear.
‐ Okay.

490
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,341
Is Dale okay with you
being here?

491
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:24,941
Shouldn't be a problem.

492
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,574
'Alright,
pupils are five millimeters'

493
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:27,607
'and react to light.'

494
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,174
Is she gonna be okay, doctor?

495
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:30,874
We're taking care of her.

496
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:32,374
Pretty good
seat belt contusion.

497
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:33,407
Yeah.

498
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,474
Bowel sounds are absent.

499
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,541
Hemoglobin's 14.1.

500
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:38,907
Okay. Listen, does this hurt?

501
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,441
‐ Ow!
‐ What's going on?

502
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:41,841
She has a bruise
from the seat belt

503
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:44,174
which is often associated
with small bowel injury.

504
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:45,774
Alright, we're gonna do
a cat scan of the belly

505
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:48,174
even if it's negative she may
need exploratory surgery.

506
00:19:48,207 --> 00:19:50,507
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Look, you'll be okay, Barbie.

507
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,841
'Mommy and daddy
will be here for you, okay?'

508
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,241
Yeah, that's all it takes?

509
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:56,407
Yeah, the machine
delivers lidocaine

510
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:57,674
to the skin
by ionophoresis

511
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:59,441
so, no needles.

512
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:01,674
Hey.

513
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,807
Dr. Weaver,
we meet again.

514
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:06,174
I‐I thought
you had a plane to catch.

515
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,907
Flight delayed,
I figure hanging out here

516
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,407
beats watered‐down
airport cocktails.

517
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,774
Mind if I play
fly on the wall?

518
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:13,741
It's Dr. Ross'
Pedes room.

519
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:14,807
Sure. Hang out.

520
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,407
Here we go, sweetheart.

521
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,641
How are you, Amanda?

522
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,274
‐ Okay.
‐ You're okay?

523
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:23,241
Now, this pad puts your skin
to sleep...alright?

524
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,474
So you're not going
to feel anything.

525
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:29,407
Now, close your eyes,
sweetheart.

526
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:31,507
‐ Do you feel anything?
‐ No.

527
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,707
‐ Okay.
‐ 'It's amazing.'

528
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:36,407
We tried numbing it with a cream
but it takes an hour.

529
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,841
‐ This is great, Doug.
‐ It really is.

530
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,807
‐ What's it called again?
‐ "Numby."

531
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:46,207
We did the phase three
clinical trials at Bellevue.

532
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,874
We've been using it
for over a year now.

533
00:20:57,374 --> 00:20:58,507
Hey, Dr. Carter.

534
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,274
Nice costume.

535
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:02,307
Yeah, I feel kind of lame.
Nobody else dressed up.

536
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,707
Well, it's early yet.
People may still show.

537
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,307
The flyer said 8:00.

538
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:08,341
You gotta remember
these are med students.

539
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,641
They're busy.

540
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,374
Do you want me to get you
some punch?

541
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:13,307
Uh, later.
I gotta go.

542
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:14,641
I gotta go pull articles
at the library

543
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,274
for this conference tomorrow.

544
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,307
That is, if you think this
party can chaperone itself.

545
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,474
I'll look after things
for ya.

546
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:20,774
Yeah. Why don't you do that?

547
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,441
‐ How old is this girl?
‐ 'Eleven.'

548
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:27,841
What's with the glitter
on her face?

549
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:29,341
She's supposed to be a princess.

550
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:31,741
Dale, get a clamp on that.

551
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,774
Babcock, please.

552
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,707
Okay. There's a little bleeding
around the duodenum.

553
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:39,374
Let's kocherize and explore
the retroperitoneum.

554
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:40,807
‐ Bovie.
‐ So, Peter.

555
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,841
What do you have planned
for Halloween?

556
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,407
Nothing special.

557
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:46,507
I know a motel on route 22,
jungle theme rooms.

558
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,707
‐ Metz.
‐ Room 14. Hanging vines.

559
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,707
You Tarzan, she Jane.
You know what I mean?

560
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,841
No. I think
we'll just stay in town.

561
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:54,641
Alright.
The pancreas looks good.

562
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:56,274
No renal injuries here.

563
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:58,441
Hold on.
There's infrarenal mass.

564
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:00,174
Looks like a lumbar node.

565
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,907
No. It doesn't
feel right.

566
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,307
It's‐it's too rubbery.

567
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:04,574
There's one on
this side, too.

568
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:05,807
Could be Lymphoma.

569
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,174
Alright. Let's send
for a biopsy.

570
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,174
'Number 15.'

571
00:22:09,974 --> 00:22:11,507
Everything okay
on the wards, Elizabeth?

572
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:12,941
Yes. Would you like
me to scrub in?

573
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,607
‐ Yeah. We could use your help.
‐ Wonderful.

574
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:18,541
We just biopsied an abnormal
lymph node on Barbie here.

575
00:22:18,574 --> 00:22:20,741
Why don't you run this specimen
down to pathology and wait

576
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:21,874
on the frozen section results.

577
00:22:25,941 --> 00:22:27,307
I signed in three more kids.

578
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,707
Our patients are stacked
to the rafters.

579
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:30,541
‐ We're getting to them.
‐ Well, not fast enough.

580
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:31,907
You need to let the main ER
handle the overflow.

581
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:33,574
I don't know.
I have to see these kids.

582
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:34,607
You saw what happened
with Kerry.

583
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,941
It's a busy night, Doug.

584
00:22:35,974 --> 00:22:37,674
One doctor can't see
them all by himself.

585
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,307
Alright, alright.

586
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,741
Send the overflow
to the main ER

587
00:22:41,774 --> 00:22:43,207
but send me the kids' charts.

588
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,574
‐ Of course.
‐ Okay.

589
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:45,874
And the sickest ones,
send them to me.

590
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,574
I wouldn't do it any other way.

591
00:22:48,874 --> 00:22:50,841
What are you doing
back so early?

592
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,307
Me and Ariel, we were
sick of trick‐or‐treating

593
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:55,207
and mom's running late.

594
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,241
What are you watching?

595
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,541
"Family love triangles."

596
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:00,607
‐ Uh huh. Educational TV, huh?
‐ Yeah.

597
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,774
Mom says that when
we move to St. Louis

598
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:04,274
she's only gonna
to let me watch

599
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,341
an hour of television a day.

600
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,807
When you move to St. Louis?

601
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,374
You didn't know?

602
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,407
I think that's why

603
00:23:15,441 --> 00:23:16,474
mom wanted to see you.

604
00:23:17,507 --> 00:23:19,174
So it's a done deal then?

605
00:23:19,207 --> 00:23:21,241
My room's gonna
be twice as big

606
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,941
'and there's a park across
the street for the dogs.'

607
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:26,641
‐ It sounds nice.
‐ 'It's really pretty there.'

608
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:30,774
Please don't tell her
I told you, okay?

609
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,207
Hey. My lips are sealed.

610
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:37,274
Prepare transversely with
running Vicryl. Three‐O.

611
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,941
Gentlemen, I have
the results of your biopsy.

612
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:42,307
Care to guess what we saw
under the microscope?

613
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:44,507
‐ Got to be Hodgkin's.
‐ 'Nope.'

614
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,274
‐ Metastatic Adeno?
‐ Wrong again.

615
00:23:47,307 --> 00:23:50,241
Seminiferous tubules.

616
00:23:50,274 --> 00:23:51,841
‐ What?
‐ You're kidding?

617
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:53,874
'You biopsied two testicles.'

618
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:56,174
It seems that Barbie is a boy.

619
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:01,241
Who knew there were so
many texts on the bowels?

620
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,807
Yeah. This is just what
I could get my hands on.

621
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:06,941
I suppose with all this intense
interest, that means our bowels

622
00:24:06,974 --> 00:24:09,474
are in good hands for
many years to come.

623
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:10,507
Right, Dr. Carter?

624
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,841
That's a nice thought.

625
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:14,241
Hey, sounds like
the party's up and running.

626
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:18,307
Party!

627
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:20,741
Whoa!

628
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:24,207

Party picked up.
The booze is right there.

638
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:59,341
Nice aim, dude.

639
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,141
You almost put out
the fire with that one.

640
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,141
Hey, Dr. Carter.

641
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,807

Party's over.

648
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,707
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

649
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,507
What's up? Were we too loud?

650
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,507
No, the furniture
was too on fire.

651
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,941
Oh, really?
I'm sorry.

652
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:34,241
I'll be in my room, studying.

653
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:35,374
Happy Halloween.

654
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:36,941
She did it to me again.

655
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:39,374
She's in escrow and I had to
hear about it from Rachel.

656
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:40,741
Maybe she was gonna
to tell you tonight.

657
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,574
Maybe, or maybe
she was just going

658
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:47,807
to send me a postcard
from St. Louis.

659
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,941
You really had a good time
with Rachel, didn't you?

660
00:25:49,974 --> 00:25:51,874
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

661
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:55,874
How's Chattarowski's
detox search going?

662
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,941
Uh, they were all out
of beds in four east

663
00:25:57,974 --> 00:25:59,841
but I stood my ground
and insisted

664
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:02,241
that he was a good
detox candidate

665
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:03,507
and finally,
they caved in

666
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,241
and gave him a place
on four west.

667
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,907
Wow. You must owe
them some favors.

668
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,207
‐ A couple, but it was worth it.
‐ Huh.

669
00:26:11,907 --> 00:26:15,374
Well, you tried, you know?

670
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,274
'When we explored
the retroperitineum'

671
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:20,374
we discovered two small masses.

672
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:22,274
Masses?
What kind of masses?

673
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:23,707
Well, we were
concerned, too

674
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:25,874
so we sent down a frozen
section of the biopsy

675
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:28,907
that revealed
testicular tissue.

676
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:30,141
What does that mean?

677
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:32,541
Barbie has a condition

678
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:35,341
called testicular
feminization.

679
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:39,374
Genetically, she's a male
with x‐y chromosomes.

680
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,474
But during development
the fetal tissue

681
00:26:41,507 --> 00:26:43,574
was resistant
to testosterone

682
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:46,707
and the external genitalia
developed as female.

683
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,474
There's got to be a mistake.

684
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,174
'No mistake.'

685
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:52,474
'The vagina's nothing
but a blind pouch.'

686
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:55,174
No uterus, nor ovaries.

687
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,874
She'll need to be on
estrogen replacement therapy.

688
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,341
My little girl
has testicles.

689
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:02,174
Actually, we had
to remove them

690
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,674
because of the high incidence
of malignant transformation.

691
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:08,374
I‐I don't understand.
I‐I changed her diapers.

692
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:10,307
'I know every inch of her.'

693
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:11,941
She's a boy?

694
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:13,574
The genetics don't matter.

695
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,741
You've raised her as a girl.
Barbie is a girl.

696
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,741
'It's what she looks like.
It's her identity.'

697
00:27:17,774 --> 00:27:19,541
Nothing will change that.

698
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,574
But you have to understand
that she'll never menstruate

699
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:22,741
or bear children.

700
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,374
Obviously,
this has come as a shock.

701
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:34,407
You'll need time to adjust.

702
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:35,541
'Barbie's recovering.'

703
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,641
We'll refer you
to a genetic counselor.

704
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:43,174
They'll help you decide
when and how to tell her.

705
00:27:44,474 --> 00:27:45,741
Thank you, doctor.

706
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:59,507
‐ Nice job.
‐ Thank you.

707
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:01,241
'Course, you forgot to mention
they'll have to change

708
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:02,607
Barbie's name to Ken.

709
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:07,674
After the day I've had,
just line them up.

710
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:10,407
Word. That's how
you got to do it, man.

711
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,741
Work hard, play hard.

712
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,507
I deserve
to play hard.

713
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,207
I had to check
all those stool samples

714
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:16,941
for fecal leukocytes, dude.

715
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:18,474
You think that's bad?

716
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:20,407
My resident
had me give physical exams

717
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:22,207
to these homeless shelter guys.

718
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:25,541
One had maggots
crawling all over an abscess.

719
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:27,807
Well, at least your residents
acknowledge your existence.

720
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,941
Mine don't even
know I'm here.

721
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,174
I get more respect
from this rubber arm.

722
00:28:36,707 --> 00:28:39,174
We might have saved this guy
if we had the saw.

723
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,274
We could have cut across
the sternum in two seconds

724
00:28:41,307 --> 00:28:42,907
instead of chiseling
for close to a minute.

725
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:44,741
Look, Kerry, the guy was dead.

726
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:46,307
Another few seconds wouldn't
have brought him back to life.

727
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:47,874
Yeah, but it would've given
him a chance.

728
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,241
C'mon, look, we are not going
to waste time and money

729
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:51,841
training ER docs on a piece
of surgical equipment

730
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:53,641
that's gonna get used,
what, once a year?

731
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,407
But if we had the saw we could
give midline thoracotomies

732
00:28:56,441 --> 00:28:58,641
for all penetrating chest
trauma with full arrest.

733
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:00,607
Yeah, we could, but that
is not the standard of care.

734
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:03,774
Oh, c'mon, the standard
of care gives miserable results.

735
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:06,274
If they arrest in the ambulance,
ten percent survive.

736
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:08,774
If they arrest
in the ER, 30% survive.

737
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,474
I think midline thoracotomy
gives us better exposure

738
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:13,207
to repair cardiac injuries.

739
00:29:13,241 --> 00:29:14,674
Alright, look, Kerry,
if you're so damned

740
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:16,307
interested in this,
why don't you do a study?

741
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:17,841
‐ Alright, I will.
‐ Good.

742
00:29:17,874 --> 00:29:19,807
I know exactly the guy from
surgery to coordinate with you.

743
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,307
Peter?

744
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,541
Kerry and I were just
discussing a joint study

745
00:29:22,574 --> 00:29:23,807
between the ER and surgery.

746
00:29:23,841 --> 00:29:25,507
‐ Study?
‐ Yeah.

747
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,807
Lateral versus midline
thoracotomy for penetrating

748
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:29,241
chest trauma with full arrest.

749
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:30,741
Is this because of today?

750
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:32,607
Kerry, why don't you draw
up a proposal including a budget

751
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,674
and have it on my desk
in the next two weeks?

752
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:35,241
‐ I will.
‐ Good. Okay.

753
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,574
Listen, I don't think ER docs

754
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:37,774
should be playing around
with a sternal saw.

755
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,241
Neither do I.

756
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:40,574
Well, then, why did
you support her?

757
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:41,841
I'm not. I'm letting
her spin her wheels.

758
00:29:41,874 --> 00:29:43,741
She'll write a proposal,
and it won't make it

759
00:29:43,774 --> 00:29:45,374
through the "Human
Subjects Committee"

760
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:46,707
in about a million years.

761
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,174
‐ M&M?
‐ Oh, no, no.

762
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:54,341
‐ Hey.
‐ Oh!

763
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:57,841
Listen, I‐I made reservations
at Dempsey's for 10:00.

764
00:29:57,874 --> 00:30:00,441
Peter, I don't know.
I'm‐I'm pretty swamped.

765
00:30:00,474 --> 00:30:01,907
What are you talking about?
It's Halloween.

766
00:30:01,941 --> 00:30:04,274
Yeah, but Dempsey's
isn't really Halloween‐y.

767
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:05,707
You know, it'll‐it'll keep.

768
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:21,807
Hey, Walt.
What's up, man? It's me.

769
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:24,807
Listen, I, uh,
I need to ask you a favor.

770
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,541
See this one?

771
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:28,774
That's the bull rider.

772
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:30,441
Alright. The cute cowboy.

773
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:31,941
Dad!

774
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:34,407
Rach, did I hear
your order right?

775
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,741
You hate rhubarb
and walnuts.

776
00:30:36,774 --> 00:30:38,574
I like it now.

777
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:40,741
Dad makes good pie.

778
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:41,907
He always did.

779
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,607
Jen, you trying
to butter me up?

780
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:47,474
No, I just remember your mom's
famous rhubarb pie recipe.

781
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,807
Sorry you have to work
late with a cold.

782
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:52,941
Are you holding up?

783
00:30:52,974 --> 00:30:55,207
Yeah, it's just
my sinuses.

784
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,207
Rachel, why don't you
go wash your hands?

785
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:58,207
Okay.

786
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,674
St. Louis, huh?

787
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:07,407
‐ She told you.
‐ It slipped out.

788
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:08,841
It's a great job, Mark.

789
00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,641
The schools are top rate, and‐‐

790
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:11,741
It sounds good.

791
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,841
I was ready for a fight.

792
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:21,541
I think we've done enough
fighting for a lifetime

793
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:22,541
don't you think?

794
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,441
Yeah.

795
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:27,907
In a perfect world
we could both spend

796
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,907
365 days a year with her,
but we can't.

797
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:37,774
‐ St. Louis isn't very far.
‐ No.

798
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,641
I'll have holidays
and summers.

799
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:45,341
Spending this time with
her this summer has..

800
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:46,774
...made me think about how..

801
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:53,274
...we spent way too much time
thinking about ourselves.

802
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,441
She told me you guys
got along really well.

803
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:57,774
Yeah.

804
00:31:59,474 --> 00:32:01,207
Yeah, it was, uh..

805
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:07,241
...it was a lot of,
it was a lot of fun.

806
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:16,474
Thank you.

807
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,741
Is it still Halloween?

808
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,307
Uh...yes.

809
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,841
You have a few
more hours left.

810
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:28,474
I guess I won't be able
to go trick‐or‐treating.

811
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:30,941
Not this year.

812
00:32:30,974 --> 00:32:32,307
I'm sorry.

813
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:34,874
Some day, huh?

814
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:38,341
That's okay.

815
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:41,907
The best part was making
the costume, anyway.

816
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:44,307
Me and my mom
made it together.

817
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,607
Do you still have my tiara?

818
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:51,207
Uh..

819
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:52,341
...yes.

820
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:54,741
Yes, right here.

821
00:32:57,707 --> 00:32:58,807
Wait, let me do that.

822
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,641
'There.'

823
00:33:04,674 --> 00:33:05,907
How do I look?

824
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:09,807
Oh! Like a beautiful
fairy princess.

825
00:33:17,507 --> 00:33:19,341
‐ No!
‐ No.

826
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:20,807
Drink up, buddy!

827
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:24,874
Some people cannot
hold their liquor.

828
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:26,507
We should totally
mess with his mind.

829
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:29,674
Oh, you mean, the‐hand‐
in‐the‐warm‐water trick?

830
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,741
Not on the couch,
Lucy. Come on.

831
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:35,156
‐ I got it. I got it.
‐ C'mon.

832
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,256
Stop it!

833
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,123
Do you think he's okay?

834
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:41,723
Yeah, he's just
a lightweight, that's all.

835
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:44,056
Oh, he has a strong pulse,
and he's still breathing.

836
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,256
You've been in the ER
way too long.

837
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,223
Let's get this party
started right!

838
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:51,290
You going to
shave his head?

839
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,990
No, that would be
cruel and unusual.

840
00:33:53,023 --> 00:33:55,623
This is mean!
This is mean.

841
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,090
‐ Here.
‐ You ain't seen nothin' yet.

842
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,590
Well, even if he was drunk,
that should still work.

843
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:03,823
No, stop, stop, stop.

844
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:05,556
‐ Wait, wait, wait. Willie?
‐ Willie.

845
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,956
Willie, wake up!

846
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:10,723
Alright, someone needs to call
911 and go get Carter.

847
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:13,123
Get real, Luce. If we call
Dr. Carter, he's gonna narc.

848
00:34:13,156 --> 00:34:15,223
No, Willie's in trouble.
We need to do something.

849
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:16,790
No, Luce, Bernie's right.
We're med students.

850
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:17,856
We can handle this.

851
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,223
This is, this is not class.

852
00:34:19,256 --> 00:34:21,156
This is our friend.
Now, you guys call 911.

853
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,590
I'm gonna go get Carter.

854
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:30,990
Dr. Carter?

855
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,923
Wake up, Dr. Carter!

856
00:34:34,956 --> 00:34:36,123
Wake up!

857
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:41,556
Okay, everybody, back off.
Give him some air.

858
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,156
‐ Anybody call 911?
‐ I did, Dr. Carter.

859
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,856
'Come on, Willie, wake up.'

860
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,623
Wake up!

861
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:50,723
I got a weak carotid pulse,
but he's not breathing.

862
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,723
Oh, man.

863
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:58,256
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh, gross!

864
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:01,123
Can I do anything?
What can I do?

865
00:35:01,156 --> 00:35:03,256
He vomited. That's‐that's,
that's good, right?

866
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,523
No, that's bad.

867
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,823
If he vomits and it gets
down in his lungs

868
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:10,190
he could die
of aspiration pneumonia.

869
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:12,690
'Alright, his parents live
in Downer's Grove.'

870
00:35:12,723 --> 00:35:13,956
‐ Here.
‐ Call them. Give them a call.

871
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,023
We're up here,
second floor!

872
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:18,656
"X," what's that?

873
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,756
‐ That's liquid ecstasy.
‐ What is that?

874
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,256
It's like a narcotic.
Did anybody else take it?

875
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,256
I don't know. I didn't even
know Willie took it.

876
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,690
Branch took some earlier.

877
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,490
‐ I can't leave Willie.
‐ I'll go.

878
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,190
It was clean. They showed
the replay a million times.

879
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,623
Oh, please! It was a joke
how offsides they were.

880
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,056
You're dreaming. Pay up.

881
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,590
Mark, that was
Lucky Liquor down the street.

882
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:38,923
Ah, a vagrant's best friend.

883
00:35:38,956 --> 00:35:41,056
They say they have a guy
in a County patient gown

884
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,223
with a yellow IV Bag
trying to buy beer.

885
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,856
What ever happened to, "No
shirt, no shoes, no service?"

886
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,656
Well, that's just it,
they're trying to stall him

887
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,123
until someone comes and gets
him but they're not gonna

888
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:50,523
hang on all day.

889
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:53,023
Alright, tell you what.
Hey, Grabarsky.

890
00:35:53,056 --> 00:35:55,723
You go down and pick
this guy up and we're even.

891
00:35:55,756 --> 00:35:57,790
‐ 'How's that sound?'
‐ This drunk a friend of yours?

892
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,956
No, but he owes
me bigger than you do.

893
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,223
Consider him admitted.

894
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:02,890
Where is he?

895
00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:04,656
Ah, his roommate said
he went to take a shower.

896
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,723
‐ How's Willie?
‐ Paramedics intubated him.

897
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:09,123
Liquid ecstasy?
These guys are med students.

898
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:11,690
‐ You think they'd know better.
‐ Yeah, you would.

899
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:14,090
Branch? Branch?

900
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,256
Branch, wake up!

901
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,256
Let's get him
out of here.

902
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:26,290
‐ No, he's not moving any air.
‐ No pulse.

903
00:36:26,323 --> 00:36:28,556
‐ Dammit!
‐ I'll start chest compressions.

904
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,890
Where's the syringe?

905
00:36:36,923 --> 00:36:38,923
I'll tell you what. Go find
the paramedics, I'll do CPR.

906
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:40,823
Okay.

907
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:50,123
Mr. Lubin just spiked
to 101.4.

908
00:36:50,156 --> 00:36:51,790
Go ahead and draw
a fever workup.

909
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:56,090
Draw a seltzer for a pre
and post‐gentamicin level

910
00:36:56,123 --> 00:36:57,523
with the 11 o'clock dose.

911
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,956
Hey, how's it going?

912
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,656
Um, we seem
to be rather busy.

913
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,623
But I've got a great little
intern helping me out.

914
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,923
Dale, listen, um.

915
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:11,223
It's 10:30 and you're not even
on so sign out the scut.

916
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:14,690
That's what
the on‐call team is for.

917
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:16,190
Unless you have
a problem with that.

918
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,023
That's fine.

919
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:25,156
You ready?

920
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,656
Give me, um, ten minutes
to get back into my costume.

921
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,656
Oh, God. You're really gonna
wear that thing, huh?

922
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,623
‐ Of course.
‐ Okay.

923
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,990
Listen, when you're ready
I'll be out front, okay?

924
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:35,856
Just tell me you wanted
to be an airline pilot.

925
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,123
Oh, please,
I don't even like

926
00:37:37,156 --> 00:37:39,290
taking a puddle jumper
to Cleveland.

927
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,556
Hurry up.

928
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:44,090
This is police harassment!

929
00:37:44,123 --> 00:37:45,523
Remember Rodney King!

930
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,023
Dr. G, here's your man.

931
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,856
He put up quite a fight.

932
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,256
Talking about it's Halloween

933
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:51,690
and how he's just
playing dress‐up.

934
00:37:51,723 --> 00:37:53,223
'I am!'

935
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:55,223
Grabarsky,
that's the wrong guy.

936
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:57,523
"Lucky Liquor, big guy
in a hospital gown."

937
00:37:57,556 --> 00:37:59,556
He kind of looks
like, uh..

938
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,690
‐ Jerry!
‐ Lloyd.

939
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:05,623
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ Who's Lloyd?

940
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:07,190
I'm that knucklehead's cousin.

941
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:09,790
Who knew they could hit
the genetic power ball twice?

942
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:10,790
Jerry.

943
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,223
Well...see,
he needed a costume

944
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:17,923
and there's a big contest
at the "Elks Lodge.."

945
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:19,856
I won an
"honorable mention," cuz.

946
00:38:20,856 --> 00:38:22,290
Congratulations.

947
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,056
Need anything else, Doug?

948
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,523
Other than a 48‐hour day?

949
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,190
I'm going to take off then.
See you bright and early.

950
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:33,056
‐ Mmm, bright and early.
‐ Yep.

951
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,223
Hey, Doug, you did
a nice job today.

952
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:38,156
'Not bad
for a rookie attending.'

953
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,690
Well, let's see how
you do with these.

954
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:42,123
What's that?

955
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:43,523
The overflow charts for the

956
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:46,090
pediatric patients
we saw in the main ER.

957
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,056
According to policy,
you need to sign off on them.

958
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,656
You're loving this,
aren't you?

959
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,823
This "Pedes ER" isn't
such a bad idea after all.

960
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,156
Happy Halloween, rookie.

961
00:39:00,856 --> 00:39:04,290
Branch Crockett and Willie
Goldman, ages 22 and 23.

962
00:39:04,323 --> 00:39:07,090
Mixed overdose
of alcohol and GHB.

963
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,790
Willie is, uh, intubated
from a respiratory arrest.

964
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:12,256
Branch came back with epi
after a full arrest.

965
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,290
What? A little
late‐night club‐hopping?

966
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:16,523
No. Med school
Halloween party.

967
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:17,523
Hmm.

968
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,090
Alright, everybody,
on my count.

969
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:22,523
One, two, three.

970
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,690
CBC, ABG,
lytes, blood alcohol

971
00:39:26,723 --> 00:39:28,690
tox screen and a 12‐lead.

972
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:30,223
Stephanie, call
respiratory for a vent.

973
00:39:30,256 --> 00:39:31,723
Someone should
call his parents.

974
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:33,290
‐ Lucy can do that.
‐ I want to help.

975
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:34,690
You're drunk.

976
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:35,956
'You don't belong
in here.'

977
00:39:37,223 --> 00:39:38,223
Now, get out.

978
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,723
Peter, have you gone
completely balmy?

979
00:39:58,623 --> 00:39:59,890
Just getting funky.

980
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,223
Hey. Meet my nephew, Peanut.

981
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,790
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ Hello.

982
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:09,919
‐ It's a hayride!
‐ Yes, it's a hayride.

983
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,686
‐ So, where to, Uncle Pete?
‐ Michigan ave.

984
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,552
Hey, pop that eight‐track in.

985
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:14,552
Solid.

986
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,052
You don't get it.

987
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:25,786
You never figured out
who I wanted to be as a kid.

988
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:30,152
Oh, my God!

989
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:31,686
Shaft.

990
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:35,252
John Shaft.

991
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:45,652
Hey, Dr. Weaver.

992
00:40:45,686 --> 00:40:47,786
Off to enjoy
"All Hallow's Eve?"

993
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:51,919
Actually, I am. I just wanted
to give you this bill.

994
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,152
$289?

995
00:40:58,186 --> 00:41:00,686
Yeah, you're lucky the
wheelchair came back undamaged.

996
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,952
It could have been
a lot worse.

997
00:41:01,986 --> 00:41:03,586
Dr. Weaver, I don't
have 300 bucks.

998
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:05,119
Well, that's why I've arranged
to have it taken

999
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:06,286
out of your paycheck.

1000
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,786
$28.90 a week
for the next ten weeks.

1001
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:12,152
That'll run right into
the "holiday buying season."

1002
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,819
‐ Kerry, you got a second?
‐ Yeah, what's going on?

1003
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:18,019
Uh, I want to give you a
head's up on the committee vote.

1004
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:19,186
Well, that's not supposed
to be announced

1005
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:20,252
until tomorrow morning.

1006
00:41:20,286 --> 00:41:22,119
Well, they've
tallied it already

1007
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:23,752
and they voted for Litvak.

1008
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:25,752
Oh.

1009
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:28,286
They're gonna to have
to widen the office door

1010
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,519
for his swollen head.

1011
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:32,919
Yeah, he's kind of
an ass, isn't he?

1012
00:41:32,952 --> 00:41:35,652
Well, if it means anything,
I voted for you.

1013
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:38,619
Thanks, Mark.

1014
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,619
Which paycheck
does this become effective?

1015
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:44,619
You know what?

1016
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:46,686
It doesn't.

1017
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,286
‐ Are you serious?
‐ I'm dead serious.

1018
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:50,852
Give your cousin
a wheelchair.

1019
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:53,119
Give your maiden aunt
a rapid infuser.

1020
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,619
I don't give a damn.

1021
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:57,986
You're getting obsessive
over this.

1022
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,619
Did I just hand
you Angiocaths?

1023
00:41:59,652 --> 00:42:00,686
Yeah, a gross.

1024
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,819
Uh, what's a gross?

1025
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,652
144, and you did.

1026
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,919
‐ Are you listening to me?
‐ Yes, I am.

1027
00:42:05,952 --> 00:42:09,186
All work and no play makes Doug
a dull boy. Now, look at this.

1028
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:11,219
I just ordered three cases
of "Pedialyte."

1029
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:12,619
This is "Pediazole."

1030
00:42:12,652 --> 00:42:14,786
This has got to be..
Ow!

1031
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:17,552
‐ Oh!
‐ Doug, you alright?

1032
00:42:17,586 --> 00:42:19,286
Oh, my God!
Hold it, hold it!

1033
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:20,686
Put pressure on it!

1034
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:24,019
You bastard.

1035
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,619
Oh, you can dish it out,
you can't take it, huh?

1036
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:26,952
‐ Oh. Oh, you know‐‐
‐ Payback is a bitch, isn't it?

1037
00:42:26,986 --> 00:42:28,952
You suck. Get away
from me, you suck.

1038
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:30,952
Good evening. Come here,
I want to suck your blood.

1039
00:42:30,986 --> 00:42:32,852
No, I'm not...no, no.
I'm not kissing back.

1040
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:38,652
Hey, Dr. Carter.

1041
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:42,019
Lucy.

1042
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,586
'How are they?'

1043
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:44,652
They'll be fine.

1044
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:49,519
I don't know
what happened.

1045
00:42:49,552 --> 00:42:51,552
'One second, we were hanging
out and the next..'

1046
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,786
What happened was two of your
classmates almost died tonight.

1047
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:58,819
I didn't know
they were doing "GHB."

1048
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:01,886
Well, you were in charge
of the party.

1049
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:03,686
I broke it up when things
got out of hand

1050
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,686
and you continued to party.

1051
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,552
Two guys rolled out
of here on gurneys.

1052
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:10,952
Uh...did I miss anything?

1053
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:14,119
The part about me not being
able to police everyone.

1054
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,219
And the part about you being
the resident advisor

1055
00:43:18,252 --> 00:43:19,519
and the one in charge.

1056
00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:20,686
Ah, you're right, Lucy.

1057
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:21,952
You know what?
I'm in charge.

1058
00:43:21,986 --> 00:43:23,286
And it was stupid of me
to think that

1059
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:25,652
you were mature enough
to take responsibility.

Come on, baby. You're messing up
one of the greatest songs.

1073
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,686
Here we go.
What is that?

1074
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,786
‐ It's my tambourine.
‐ That's a tambourine?

1075

'Come on, come on, come on.'

1076
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:12,519
'Get some rhythm in here.'
