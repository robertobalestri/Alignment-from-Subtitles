1
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:06,600
Previously on ER..

2
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:08,266
Medical students
don't know anything.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,300
It's your job to teach them,
not be their friend.

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,733
You've something personal
against this girl?

5
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:14,200
Do you think I should sit down
and talk to Dr. Carter?

6
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,100
You don't wanna be
confrontational from the get go.

7
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,533
You're getting defensive.
You don't even hear me.

8
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,400
Don't talk to each other.
Talk to me.

9
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:22,333
One good thing about Lucy,
she's not here.

10
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:25,633
Whatever this is, I can't fix
it. Work it out both of you.

11
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,533
Alright, hook her back up
to the pulse ox.

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:35,700
Hang 500 of saline.

13
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,433
'BP's 120/30. Pulse 80.'

14
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,066
‐ You got that second crit?
‐ It's coming.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,500
Daddy, it hurts.

16
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:43,566
I know, honey, I know,
but they're gonna help.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,266
Everything's gonna
be alright.

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,100
Ah, oh, can't you give
her something?

19
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,433
Uh‐huh, Carol, titrate another
two of morphine.

20
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,700
'I got the CT's.'

21
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,400
‐ Where's Dr. Greene?
‐ On his way.

22
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:53,066
Alright, page Benton.
We've got a splenic injury.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,133
Well, is that bad?

24
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,533
Daddy, you're bleeding.

25
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,266
Lucy, I thought you were
gonna suture him.

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,666
He wanted to go
to CT with her.

27
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,666
Crit's 24 after 600cc's.

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,433
‐ The last one?
‐ Thirty three.

29
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:04,066
Alright, Mr. Sawyer, we should
really get that sutured.

30
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,633
Why don't you come
with me?

31
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,500
Okay, wh‐what's going on
and what's wrong with her?

32
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,233
'Your daughter is bleeding
from her spleen.'

33
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,300
Oh, my God.

34
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,533
Most splenic injuries
this size

35
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:12,700
heal on their own especially
in children.

36
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,466
Oh, so‐so‐so,
what do you do?

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,666
If she remains stable, nothing
except transfusing blood.

38
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,266
So, why don't you let
Miss knight suture that cut.

39
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,066
‐ I'll come find you‐‐
‐ No, no, no!

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,200
I wanna be with her.

41
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,266
Not until we take care
of that gash.

42
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
I want to keep her calm.

43
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,733
Aa‐aa‐aa Corinna, Corinna

44
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,433
I'm just gonna be right
next door here, okay?

45
00:01:26,466 --> 00:01:28,433
‐ More nylon, Lucy.
‐ I know.

46
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:30,500
‐ Okay, I love you, sweetie.
‐ I love you.

47
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,533
‐ Lucy, can you get consent?
‐ Yeah.

48
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,766
‐ Right in here.
‐ Never saw it coming.

49
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,433
Ah‐ah, this van, it just came
out of nowhere and just hit us.

50
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,200
You're gonna to need
to sign this. Sit down.

51
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,633
Well, what is it?

52
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,733
It authorizes blood transfusion
and emergency surgery.

53
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,466
I thought she
didn't need surgery.

54
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,300
Well, probably not.
This is just in case.

55
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,266
Well, how long?

56
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,166
Ah, how long
will she have to stay?

57
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,800
It's hard to tell.
Do you have insurance?

58
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,133
What?

59
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,633
Uh, yeah, but I
left it in my wallet

60
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,466
in the glove compartment and I'm
not sure I can get to it.

61
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Well, that's okay.
We can call.

62
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,300
Which insurance company
is it?

63
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,600
Uh, Blue...cross.

64
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,533
Listen, can you
do me a favor

65
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,466
and call her mother
in Cleveland.

66
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,566
I...she should, she should know
what's happening.

67
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,166
Do you wanna use the phone?

68
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
Um, no, no.

69
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,166
It's‐it's best
that you make the call.

70
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,166
Please.

71
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,366
A multi‐victim MVA,
father‐daughter.

72
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,100
CT on the daughter shows
a grade‐two splenic lac.

73
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,733
She's stable, but her crit
dropped nine points.

74
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:27,766
How's the father?

75
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
He's got a minor
scalp lac

76
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,533
crit of 42, awake,
alert, oriented.

77
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,200
‐ What's her name?
‐ Corinna.

78
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,466
Ah, can you take a breath
for me, please? Good.

79
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,233
Hi, Corinna, I'm Dr. Greene.
How are you feeling?

80
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,333
My back hurts.

81
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:40,766
Your back?
Not your tummy?

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,166
Where's my daddy?

83
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,466
He's right next door, sweetie.

84
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,733
She has rigors,
warm to the touch.

85
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,500
Probable febrile reaction
to the transfusion.

86
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:49,600
How many units
of blood are in?

87
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:50,666
That's her first.

88
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,500
I need saline

89
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:57,466
rectal Tylenol, 500 milligrams,
25‐IV Benadryl.

90
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,733
'Uh‐oh!'

91
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,033
'Corinna!'

92
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,133
BP's down to 60 palp.

93
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,233
Corinna?

94
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,400
Has this blood
been cross‐matched?

95
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,533
No, it's type specific.

96
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,366
There's pink urine
in the Foley bag.

97
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,700
She must be hemolyzing
her blood cells.

98
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,633
Yeah, she could also be bleeding
from the spleen.

99
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,433
Maybe both. 500cc bolus of
saline. Stand by with epi.

100
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,266
Alright, mix a dopamine drip.

101
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,633
We're sure she got
type specific?

102
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,066
‐ It says B positive on the bag.
‐ That's her type.

103
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,800
Alright, retype that blood
and the patient.

104
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,633
They may have mislabeled it up
in the blood bank.

105
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,400
Add a CBC

106
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,133
haptoglobin, free hemoglobin

107
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,433
direct, indirect coombs

108
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,433
PT, PTT.

109
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:32,700
What's going on?

110
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,333
Hemolytic reaction
to the blood transfusion.

111
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:36,333
Immune system's chewing up
the red blood cells.

112
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,666
Aren't you supposed
to be suturing her father.

113
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
He wants me to call the mother.

114
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,266
Go ask the father
if his daughter

115
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,766
has any history of
hematologic disease.

116
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
Now!

117
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,033
Add a BUN, creatinine.
Let's get..

118
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,200
Mr. Sawyer?

119
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,066
'Hey, Dr. Ross.'

120
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,166
Isn't it a little late
for golf?

121
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,566
Never too late
for golf.

122
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,533
‐ It's November.
‐ What'd I just say, Jerry?

123
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,600
You people are crazy.
Carter's going sailing.

124
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:54,733
Hey, way to go, Carter.

125
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,066
Hold on. You're rambling‐‐

126
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,166
His name is not Sawyer,
it's Nelson.

127
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,566
He kidnapped Corinna
two weeks ago

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,633
from her mother's,
in Cleveland.

129
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,066
Her mother
told you this?

130
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah, and she's on her way
to the airport.

131
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,566
She's gonna be here
as soon as she can.

132
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,766
‐ So why would Sawyer‐‐
‐ Nelson!

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,433
Why would he give you
her phone number?

134
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:07,766
I don't know, uh,
he freaked out.

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,133
He heard his daughter
might need surgery

136
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,300
and he'd be discovered.

137
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,066
Dr. Greene,
we have a situation here.

138
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,166
Uh, just a
second, Carter.

139
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,333
Are those the labs
on the girl?

140
00:05:15,366 --> 00:05:16,700
‐ Yeah.
‐ UA Shows one‐plus bilirubin.

141
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,366
‐ Are you on?
‐ Just passing through.

142
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,533
So, they mislabel
the blood?

143
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,300
No. Cross‐reactions
to minor antigens.

144
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,133
We're gonna have trouble
matching this one.

145
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,300
'There's none
in the blood bank.'

146
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,333
Can I see it?

147
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,666
Carter, did you type the family?

148
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,200
I drew a CBC on the father
yeah, but he took off.

149
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,366
Looks like he kidnapped her.

150
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
‐ What?
‐ A bad custody case.

151
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,266
I talked to the mother and she's
on her way in from Cleveland.

152
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,200
Crit's dropping down to 22.
We got to get her up to the OR.

153
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:36,733
‐ There's no blood.
‐ What's the problem?

154
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:38,633
Right, Carter, ah, type
and screen dad's blood

155
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,800
and then get on the phone
and start calling

156
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,366
all the other blood banks.

157
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,433
‐ I'll try.
‐ Lucy, call this mother back.

158
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,700
Get the girl's medical records

159
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,066
and see if mom can have
her blood screened.

160
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,400
She's on her way
to the airport.

161
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,633
Get to her before she takes off.

162
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,333
She's bleeding.
We don't have much time.

163
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,733
Well, let's watch her.
The spleen could tamponade.

164
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,400
No, not with her crit
falling like that.

165
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:54,600
‐ That's the hemolysis.
‐ Come on, you don't know that.

166
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,533
You don't know
it's the spleen.

167
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,100
'One thing at a time.
We're looking for blood.'

168
00:05:58,133 --> 00:05:59,633
'Crit's what, 22?'

169
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,033
We have a cushion.

170
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,433
Let's hit her hard
with steroids.

171
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,333
Carol, 500 milligrams
Solu‐Medrol.

172
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,600
Um, might
not be enough.

173
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,033
You want me to take
a look at her?

174
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,166
Be my guest.
Peter, you gonna stick around?

175
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,133
Sure. You're just gonna be
paging me in 15 minutes, anyway.

176
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,800
You called Doug, huh?

177
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,700
Yeah. It seemed pretty
complicated.

178
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,166
No problem.

179
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,766
That covers the entire state?

180
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,066
Sorry, I'm late.
You ready to go?

181
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Hey, just a sec.
And what about Indiana?

182
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,433
Just give me two minutes.
I'm kinda tied up here.

183
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,033
Okay.

184
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,600
What are you doing
going sailing?

185
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,400
My uncle's boat is still
in Burnham Harbor

186
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,166
and John offered to motor
it in to dry dock

187
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,133
with me while we still
have decent weather.

188
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,600
Well, I heard it was
supposed to rain.

189
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,266
I caught the mother
at the boarding gate.

190
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,233
She's faxing her release
for the medical records.

191
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,766
Remembers Corinna
had a transfusion

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
for hyperbilirubinemia
as an infant.

193
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,466
Okay, thank you very much.

194
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,533
‐ Hi, Lucy.
‐ Hi.

195
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:49,666
Unfortunately, the mother

196
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
has a different blood type.

197
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,333
Figures. Dad matches.

198
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,033
‐ Exactly?
‐ To the antibody.

199
00:06:54,066 --> 00:06:55,300
We gotta find him.

200
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,066
I'm just gonna leave
you kids alone.

201
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,233
Um, I've got a couple
of phone calls to make.

202
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,600
Uh, uh, but you've got
15 minutes, mister.

203
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:02,766
You're leaving?

204
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,366
As soon as I
find this blood.

205
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,566
Great. So I can go.

206
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Yeah, sure, Lucy, bail.

207
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,266
National Blood
Registry, please.

208
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,066
I'm gonna go find the father.
He left an address.

209
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,600
He's a fugitive. He didn't give
you the right address.

210
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,566
My shift it over. You said
I could go, so I'm going.

211
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,500
Whatever.

212
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:17,800
Why do you have
to be such an ass about it?

213
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,466
Lucy, I don't care
what you do.

214
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,333
I'm gonna try and find
blood for his kid.

215
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,666
‐ So am I.
‐ Crit's down to 19.

216
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,300
Steroids aren't working.

217
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,266
Let's go IVIG, 25 grams
over four hours.

218
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,200
Come on, Doug, I gave you time
to treat the hemolysis.

219
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,266
Now we've gotta stop the splenic
bleeding up in the OR.

220
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,033
She's not
hemodynamically stable.

221
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,066
Okay. I'll use
the cell saver.

222
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,700
The serum you'd cycle would
keep destroying her cells.

223
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,200
Any word on
the blood?

224
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,033
She has antibodies
to both vel and lan.

225
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,366
One is found in four
out of 10,000 people.

226
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,100
The other, one
in 25,000 people.

227
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,033
She's got both,
so do the math.

228
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:52,400
You know
the father matched.

229
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:53,533
Let's hope
he comes back.

230
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:55,533
One in 50 million,
the math.

231
00:07:55,566 --> 00:07:57,800
There's nothing in the Midwest,
the rare donor program

232
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:00,100
is on it, but they're not
optimistic.

233
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:01,500
We can't wait
that long.

234
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:03,400
Anesthesiologist won't put
her under with this crit.

235
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,700
No, that's why I wanted
to operate when she was at 22.

236
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:09,166
Right now, donor blood
is her best chance.

237
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,433
We'll manage her medically
till we get it.

238
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,500
If we get it.

239
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,066
Did you reach
that hematologist?

240
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,133
Yeah. He's on his way.

241
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,400
Alright, why don't you go home?

242
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,466
What?

243
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,166
You've been here
since midnight.

244
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,233
Yeah, but...I‐I took her.

245
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, listen, you know

246
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,233
we've handed off patients
before. You're covered.

247
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:28,666
‐ You got three docs here.
‐ Okay.

248
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,266
Maybe I'll call in later,
see how things are going.

249
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,166
Hey, Mark? Can you use
albumin to prime dialysis?

250
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,566
What are you thinking?

251
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,700
Plasmapheresis.

252
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,700
I don't know
if that'll help.

253
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,500
Couldn't hurt.

254
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:45,766
No, you can arrange
for it to be in addition

255
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,066
to your pension plan.

256
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Tax free?

257
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,233
Okay. You ready to go?

258
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,266
That's him.

259
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,666
‐ Dr. Carter.
‐ Yeah?

260
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,600
'James Middleton, Chicago PD.'

261
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,166
I ran that license number.

262
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Turns out
it's a dealer plate.

263
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,700
'Used car lot
on Western and Addison.'

264
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,433
What license number?

265
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:03,633
'On the totaled
Grand Am.'

266
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,666
You guys called in
about a kidnapping.

267
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,400
Um, Jerry said
this was your case.

268
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,600
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Did you find the father?

269
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,066
Who?

270
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,533
They were
in the accident together.

271
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:15,466
He had us call her mom
and then he just took off.

272
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,466
‐ This is a custody dispute?
‐ Mom said he stole her.

273
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,766
‐ When?
‐ Two weeks ago.

274
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,266
‐ Well, is the mom here?
‐ No. She's flying in.

275
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,266
Okay, I'll tell you what,
why don't you have her

276
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,166
give me a call
when she gets here.

277
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah. That might be too late.
We really need to find this guy.

278
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,333
It's a lot of
"he said, she said"

279
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:30,766
with these kinda things.

280
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,300
He might have visitation rights
for a couple of weeks.

281
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,233
No, no, it's not that.
We need his blood.

282
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,366
His daughter
could die without it.

283
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,033
'Did he leave
any credit information?'

284
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,533
‐ No.
‐ Social security number?

285
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:43,733
No, nothing. Just an address
but I'm sure it's bogus.

286
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:45,733
Alright. I'll check it out,
try the used car lot.

287
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,300
Maybe I can come up
with something.

288
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Hope so.

289
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,400
Okay. Line's in.

290
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,033
Let me get
a heparin flush.

291
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,600
Where's the plasmapheresis unit?

292
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:56,800
On the way down.

293
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,700
Daddy..

294
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,800
Hi, honey.

295
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,766
Connie, can you
get Doug, please?

296
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,366
Where's my daddy?

297
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,533
You're in a hospital.

298
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,166
'You were in
an accident, remember?'

299
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,066
Does your tummy hurt?

300
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,333
Where's my daddy?

301
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,366
We're gonna take
good care of you.

302
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,466
My name is Carol.

303
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
I want my daddy.

304
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,133
Your mom's coming.
She'll be here soon.

305
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,333
Daddy?

306
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,566
Your daddy's fine.

307
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,766
He's just...he's just
not here right now.

308
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,333
Why?

309
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,800
You don't remember me,
but you remember your dog.

310
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,800
‐ I'm sure it's only temporary.
‐ How's yours going?

311
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,500
Well, he's either suffering
short‐term memory loss

312
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,533
or saw the accident
as a last chance to back out.

313
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,400
Any word from
the rare donor program?

314
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,166
Yeah.
Two words "still looking."

315
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,700
You know what, I got
a friend at NIH

316
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,200
who's an expert
in blood banking.

317
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,533
‐ I'll give him a call.
‐ Great. Thanks.

318
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,433
Dr. Greene, ah, Carter asked
me to give you this.

319
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,100
He said there may be
a detective calling

320
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,166
you later about the father.

321
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,300
Is he still here?

322
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,366
No. He and Roxanne left
a while ago.

323
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,566
No, I meant the detective‐‐

324
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
'Mark, she's seizing!'

325
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:10,566
‐ How long?
‐ Almost a minute.

326
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
'I've got the phenobarbital.'

327
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:13,500
Push a third mig
of Ativan first.

328
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,766
‐ Yeah, Accucheck's 40.
‐ I need D‐50.

329
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,266
‐ What's her crit?
‐ Seventeen.

330
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,333
‐ Get another H and H.
‐ She's hypoxic.

331
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,800
Heart and kidneys
could go next.

332
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,333
‐ BP's 100/60.
‐ Alright, I'm gonna intubate.

333
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,733
‐ Push the phenobarb.
‐ Not going to do it.

334
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,400
We need some damn blood.

335
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:29,266
Doctor, hurry it up.

336
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,433
Alright.
Thanks, Jerry.

337
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:34,166
Okay. So there was
this girl named Soup.

338
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,300
Do not ask me why
they called her Soup.

339
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,233
Anyway, she was, like two years
older than us, so we thought

340
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:42,700
she was really cool,
and somehow, she convinced us

341
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,300
to sunbathe topless
on this deck

342
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,033
and I'm not
kidding you

343
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,100
John, my breasts were purple

344
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:54,166
and they had blisters
all over these..

345
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,466
Wow.

346
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,533
Have you heard anything
I've just been saying?

347
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:03,633
‐ Yeah.
‐ No. No, really.

348
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,533
What, what did I just say?

349
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,433
Huh?

350
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:12,166
I'm sorry. I was thinking
about that girl.

351
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,300
'You know, I should
really follow up.'

352
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,800
Thought you said
they had that covered.

353
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,233
Yeah, yeah, there was just
this one other thing

354
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,166
that I wanted to check.

355
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,066
Can you handle
this without me?

356
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,200
No. No.

357
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,200
Ah, come on.
It's no big deal.

358
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:34,433
Just powering it up the river.

359
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:36,300
John, you're not the only one
with a busy schedule.

360
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,033
I made time
for this, too.

361
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:41,000
I know, but I have to try
to find this guy.

362
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,400
Because Lucy's looking for him?

363
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,566
Lucy's probably home by now.

364
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,633
Right.

365
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,300
Come on. Get on the boat.

366
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,066
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

367
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,666
What?
I, I can't hear you.

368
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:22,266
A loaner.

369
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,400
Cars we loan to customers

370
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,666
to run errands stuff like that.

371
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,300
The owner must
have gave it out.

372
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,633
‐ Can I talk to him?
‐ He's in Vegas.

373
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,266
He's winning,
we never hear from him.

374
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,600
And there's no
paperwork on it?

375
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,266
We're pretty lax
about stuff like that.

376
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,066
Hey, Mort.
Leave that stuff out.

377
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,166
The rain's passing
through.

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,266
It's really important
that we find

379
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,466
the guy that was driving.

380
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,133
Yeah, the cops said
something like that.

381
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,300
I wish I could help.

382
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,666
I don't know what
they told you, but..

383
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
He was in the accident
with his daughter

384
00:13:45,133 --> 00:13:46,133
and she's dying.

385
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,166
His blood may be
the only thing

386
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
that could save her life.

387
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,533
And there's no other
way to find him?

388
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,166
‐ Just the car.
‐ Gee, that sucks.

389
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah.

390
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,433
Ah, I'd help
you if I could, man.

391
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,700
Alright.
Would you give me a call?

392
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,333
Yeah, I'll give you a call
if I hear anything.

393
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,466
Hey, hold up.

394
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,600
Look, you say anything
to the cops, I'll deny it.

395
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:11,633
I loaned the car
to my bookie.

396
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,766
Your bookie?
What's his name?

397
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,666
He's your guy, Nelson.

398
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,100
I still owe some money.

399
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:18,266
He's been good
about my payment plan.

400
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,566
He came in on Friday,
wanted to borrow

401
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,333
a car for a few days
while he had his daughter

402
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:22,466
and I said sure.

403
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,566
Do you know how
to get in touch him?

404
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,166
I only met him one other time.

405
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,533
Then how did, how did‐‐

406
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,233
I placed my bets with
the bellhop at the Delaware.

407
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,200
There's no gambling
on the premises.

408
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,500
No‐no‐no,
I didn't mean you.

409
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,300
I didn't mean you,
but I was told that

410
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,766
there was a bellboy around
here who covered some bets.

411
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,533
Well, I thought I just
heard myself say

412
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,433
"there's no gambling
on the premises."

413
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,166
Right, not officially.
Sure.

414
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,266
Like there's
no prostitutes, huh?

415
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,366
Excuse me!

416
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,033
...Remember
and if you think of..

417
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,500
I wonder...what are
you doing here?

418
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,733
Look, I wasn't doing anything.

419
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,700
‐ No, I meant her.
‐ Just a minute.

420
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,400
Hey, you work for a bookie
named Nelson?

421
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,066
‐ I got to get back to work.
‐ Wait, wait, wait.

422
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,500
‐ Just a second, please?
‐ Look I told you‐‐

423
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,066
No, you said you knew a guy.

424
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,433
Just a name. Just give me
a name, please?

425
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:12,533
‐ Hey, excuse me.
‐ What is it? Money?

426
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:14,300
‐ We've got money.
‐ Let me go, man.

427
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,133
‐ Hey, we gotta find this guy.
‐ Look, get off me, man.

428
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,766
I told you I don't know
what you're talking about.

429
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:21,366
Thank you.

430
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,433
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ What?

431
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:24,733
He was about to tell me

432
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:27,333
about the guy who runs
bets for Nelson.

433
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:29,066
How did you even know
Nelson was a bookie?

434
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,600
Neighborhood gossip.
It turns out that address

435
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,233
wasn't fake.
It was just old.

436
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,800
And what are you doing here?
I thought you had a date.

437
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,166
No, we're having trouble finding
a blood match at the hospital.

438
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,766
‐ I thought it was worth a shot.
‐ Did they operate?

439
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,533
Not until they can get her crit
up. She had a seizure.

440
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,300
Hey, what kinda action
you looking for?

441
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,800
I can handle OTB, games,
numbers. Whatever you want.

442
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,066
Well, I just looking
for this guy.

443
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,133
His daughter's
in the hospital.

444
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, okay. See you.

445
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:49,366
No, wait,
we want to bet.

446
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,100
Yo, we wanna
place a bet.

447
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,333
It's just that Nelson
told us to talk

448
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,666
to a bellhop boy.

449
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,333
Whoa, when did he tell
you this? The Ice Age?

450
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,566
‐ Toby got fired.
‐ Toby?

451
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,066
He covers Nelson's action.

452
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,633
‐ So, where is this Toby live?
‐ I don't know.

453
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,233
He's‐he's one
of those Ghetto Boys

454
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,466
the butcher gets jobs
for him in the city.

455
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,566
The who?

456
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,100
This, uh, lost youth guy.

457
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,033
Works at a meat packing plant.

458
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:10,533
So walk in the room
and look at the name tags.

459
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:12,433
Yeah, Jerry. Can you
answer that, please?

460
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,733
Uh, Chuny, do you mind?

461
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Jerry, what is this?

462
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,433
We're not moving patients,
triage is all over me.

463
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:19,800
No, no, no, only emergent
cases get on the board

464
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,500
until we have a free bed.
Any luck?

465
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:25,233
No. He hasn't answered my page.
I'm trying to track him down.

466
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,600
So, what do you want
me to do with all these charts?

467
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,300
‐ Where's Doyle?
‐ Hey, I'm doing my share.

468
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,800
You've been with the girl
and Dr. Weaver's been

469
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,133
on the phone for the last hour.

470
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,633
I'll take the LP
and the migraine.

471
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,266
You take the Treat
and Streets.

472
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,633
‐ And get Jerry some free beds.
‐ Thank you.

473
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,466
Benton wants to call
down Anspaugh.

474
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,133
‐ Any blood?
‐ Not yet.

475
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,100
Mark, Corinna's mother's
at O'Hare. She wants an update.

476
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,233
Well, just get her over here.
I'll brief her in person.

477
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,233
I got Lucy on line three.
She wants a status report.

478
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,566
‐ Carol.
‐ Yeah , I got it.

479
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,166
I'm holding
for John Derby, Derby, yes.

480
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,633
‐ Derby, the NIH Guy?
‐ Yes.

481
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:55,200
Yeah, he returned your call,
returned your page

482
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,366
left a mobile number.

483
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,700
Jerry, why didn't
you tell me?

484
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,533
You've been on the phone.

485
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,366
'Okay, thanks, Carol.'

486
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,600
Wait‐wait, slow down. I don't
think this is the right way.

487
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,400
She said it was
past the conveyor belt.

488
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,466
What conveyor belt?
All I see is beef.

489
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,166
Here, here,
whoa, God.

490
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,166
‐ Any luck?
‐ No. No match yet.

491
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,766
We're looking
for the boning room.

492
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,666
What exactly happens
in the boning room?

493
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,533
Uh, this is
the wrong way.

494
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:23,600
I didn't see
you leading.

495
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,300
Alright, I'll lead then.

496
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:28,766
Hey! Where are you going?

497
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,466
To find the boning room.

498
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,766
You said I could lead.

499
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,633
I didn't say,
I'd follow you.

500
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,300
Look, I didn't ask
you to come with me.

501
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,533
I didn't ask
you to come with me.

502
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:38,266
I'm not with you.
I came looking first.

503
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,766
What does that mean?

504
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,266
It means
that if you were right

505
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,133
you wouldn't be walking
around a meat locker.

506
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,100
I wouldn't be walking
around a meat locker

507
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:48,200
'if you hadn't
let the guy go.'

508
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,300
I knew it. I knew you blamed me.

509
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,566
A little girl's dying, Lucy.

510
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
You can relax about you.

511
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,266
Hey!

512
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
Hey!

513
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,666
‐ What?
‐ Boning room.

514
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,500
This city can build
youth detention centers

515
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,066
ten years before
they're needed

516
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,233
but they can't start
a job program for kids.

517
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,433
Prisons, yes.

518
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,766
Jobs, no.

519
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, at this job,
apparently Toby took

520
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,233
bets for a man named Nelson.

521
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:18,133
Not everybody
is a success story.

522
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,333
Do you know
where we can find him?

523
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,766
Sorry, I don't
snitch on my kids.

524
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,600
They don't trust you,
it's over.

525
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:24,600
You want to save kids?

526
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,166
I got one you can save.

527
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,700
Crit's leveled
off at 16.

528
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,300
I think we stopped
the hemolysis.

529
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,500
Her kidneys are failing.

530
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:36,166
She's already had
two seizures.

531
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,266
If her spleen
is still bleeding.

532
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,633
She's gonna die.

533
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,566
No one is disagreeing
that she needs surgery.

534
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,200
The question is,
how long can we wait for blood?

535
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,400
It may never come.

536
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,366
Look, at some point

537
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
there's such a thing
as desperate measures.

538
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:49,633
We're not there yet.

539
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,033
Oh, my God!

540
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,700
Corinna.

541
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,033
Can she hear me? Corinna.

542
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,500
'She's been drifting
in and out.'

543
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,600
Maybe we should
type the mom.

544
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:58,733
I did while
I was explaining

545
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,300
Corinna's condition
to her.

546
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,233
‐ A positive.
‐ I can't give it anyway?

547
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,666
It's gotta be better
than nothing.

548
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,300
She needs a perfect match.

549
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,466
And Keith has it?

550
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,500
How typical?

551
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,566
He takes her,
he hurts her

552
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,766
and he runs away
when she needs him.

553
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,033
‐ Got it!
‐ What?

554
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:17,600
NIH found a match. Two frozen
units in Nashville .

555
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,066
'How long before it gets here?'

556
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,266
It'll be in the air
in ten minutes.

557
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,466
Alright, let's get
her to pre‐op.

558
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,366
'Hang on, hang on.'

559
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,500
'I want to be ready
the minute it gets here.'

560
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,233
There's number eight.

561
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,666
This is nuts.
This is nuts.

562
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,266
Even if we find this Toby
he might not even know Nelson.

563
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,433
We're here.
We might as well try.

564
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,500
‐ Have a little faith.
‐ Have a little faith?

565
00:19:36,533 --> 00:19:38,600
In what? In our ability to find
one guy in all of Chicago?

566
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,333
Well, then you go home.
I'll find him myself.

567
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,600
Yeah, right.

568
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:44,633
'Be right back.'

569
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,066
Where are you going?

570
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,100
‐ Yeah.
‐ Hi. Is Toby here?

571
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,433
Who are you?

572
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,800
Hi.

573
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,400
Do you live here?

574
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,233
Where are your clothes?

575
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,733
He doesn't talk much.

576
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,200
Are you his sister?

577
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,533
Who's that?

578
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,766
His mom.
She's sick.

579
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,733
That's pretty
bad cough.

580
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:14,266
Has she had it
for a long time?

581
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,733
A while.

582
00:20:15,766 --> 00:20:17,166
What's her name?

583
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
Mrs. Price.

584
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,466
Maybe I should go in,
and take a look.

585
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,066
See if she's okay.

586
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,133
You shouldn't go in there.

587
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,566
'That's not your house.'

588
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,033
It's okay 'cause I'm a doctor.

589
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,500
Would you watch
him for a couple of minutes?

590
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah?

591
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,533
'Hello?'

592
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,066
Hello? Mrs. Price?

593
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,033
'Who‐who's there?'

594
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,466
My name is Dr. Carter.

595
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,300
I just saw your boy outside.

596
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,266
Don't be afraid.

597
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,600
I just came in to see
if you're okay.

598
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:09,066
Who‐who let...who let you in?

599
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,466
The door was open.

600
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,766
And I heard
you coughing.

601
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,666
It's uh, it's bronchitis.

602
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
'I've had it before.'

603
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:22,166
Are you coughing up blood?

604
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,066
'Is that blood you're
coughing up?'

605
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,200
A little.

606
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,233
Any fever?

607
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,400
'Has anybody ever done
a TB test on you?'

608
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,333
Have they done a TB test?
And they prick your arm?

609
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:33,800
You hold on, sweetheart.

610
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,133
We're going to get
you some help.

611
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,700
Ah!

612
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,300
What the hell
you think you doing?

613
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,600
‐ I'm just trying to help.
‐ Yeah, right.

614
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,133
'I told you not
to come in here.'

615
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,466
Ariel, go home
and stay there.

616
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,600
‐ I need to call 911.
‐ Yeah, if you're lucky.

617
00:21:47,633 --> 00:21:49,633
Look, I'm a doctor.

618
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,633
That woman has tuberculosis.

619
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,300
It's highly contagious.

620
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,300
I want her on 100% oxygen, ac‐14

621
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,466
title volume 250.
Set up two blood‐Y's now.

622
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,800
Who's on for anesthesia?

623
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,233
‐ Babcock.
‐ Alright, let's get him here.

624
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,433
‐ Where are we going?
‐ OR three.

625
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,466
Find me when the blood
gets here.

626
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,733
I'll meet you in there, Peter.

627
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:05,233
Ma'am, ma'am,
you can't go in here.

628
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,633
We are taking
her straight to the OR.

629
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,066
‐ Well, what do I do?
‐ Just Wait out here.

630
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,366
Someone will come
and talk to you.

631
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,033
She won't lose more
blood during the surgery?

632
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,700
The other doctor said
she had a low blood count.

633
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,200
'I know, that's why
we're waiting for donor blood.'

634
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,600
Hopefully, we can get
her count up high enough

635
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,266
to operate safely
and stop internal bleeding

636
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,533
and prevent any further
blood loss.

637
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:20,233
And she'll be okay
until then?

638
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:26,500
I talked to toby's sister.

639
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,600
She says he hangs out
at a mini‐mart up there.

640
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,433
Alright. Hold on, We need to
wait for the paramedics.

641
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:32,166
‐ What paramedics?
‐ Woman in there with active TB.

642
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,333
She's got a lil' boy. The whole
project could be infected.

643
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,066
‐ She thinks he's there now‐‐
‐ Just give me a second.

644
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,600
‐ Okay, I'll go myself‐‐
‐ No. We should go together.

645
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:39,266
I'm going now.

646
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,566
God forbid, you should listen
to me and learn something!

647
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,200
What do you think, I don't
want to learn things?

648
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:45,800
‐ Not from me.
‐ 'Cause I disagree with you?

649
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,233
Lucy, I have experience.
You could at least respect that.

650
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,500
Carter, I'm just trying
to find this guy..

651
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:52,166
‐ What?
‐ That's him.

652
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,766
Mr. Nelson! Wait.

653
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,633
Mr. Nelson!

654
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,166
‐ Wait!
‐ Nelson!

655
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,700
Nelson!

656
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:10,600
‐ Sorry. Emergency!
‐ Hey! Hey!

657
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,133
Hey, Where do you think
you're going?!

658
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:29,566
No, no, no!
I gotta stop that guy!

659
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,166
‐ The fare's a buck fifty!
‐ Let me go! Nelson!

660
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,433
'Wait, nelson!'

661
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,066
Nelson.
Damn it!

662
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,366
Go back down there
and buy a fare‐‐

663
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,033
Congratulations! You just killed
a little girl.

664
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:39,200
Fare's a buck fifty.

665
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,233
Buck fifty!
Buck fifty!

666
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,766
There's your buck fifty.

667
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,233
‐ Hey, you better back off, pal!
‐ Alright.

668
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,133
Son of a bitch!

669
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,800
The blood bank's deglycerolizing
and thawing now.

670
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,266
It'll be 20 minutes.

671
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,133
‐ Crit's down to 15.
‐ Put her under.

672
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,633
‐ I don't wanna waste any time.
‐ Your call.

673
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,466
‐ You okay, Peter?
‐ Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

674
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,133
Listen, get Anspaugh in here.
Come on, come on. Lets move.

675
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,500
I didn't even know
Nelson had a daughter.

676
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,100
She doesn't have
much time, Toby.

677
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,266
It's really important
that we find him.

678
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,700
He just picked up
his money

679
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,166
and said he might be leaving
town in a couple of days.

680
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,566
‐ You can't call him?
‐ He pages me.

681
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,133
‐ From where?
‐ Different places.

682
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,500
You were runnin'
numbers for the man

683
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:44,200
and you can't
tell them where to find him?

684
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,333
It ain't like
we friends. It's business.

685
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:46,666
Hell, what if I get pinched?

686
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,366
You better hope
you don't get pinched.

687
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,166
If he knew Corinna's condition,
he'd want you to tell us.

688
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,033
I am telling you.
I don't know how to find him.

689
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,400
If I did, I'd go myself.

690
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:55,133
Alright.
What about, uh..

691
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:56,533
...other business contacts?

692
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:59,366
He has guys at ballparks
to take last‐minute action.

693
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,733
'Yo, wait a minute.'

694
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,666
He got this uncle, a grounds guy
at soldier field.

695
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,733
Uncle Joey.

696
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:09,266
Crit's down to 14.

697
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,633
‐ How long do we wait?
‐ Here she is.

698
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:12,766
‐ Is that it?
‐ Bad news.

699
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
Come on,
don't tell me.

700
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,533
There were small holes
in the bags.

701
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,333
'We couldn't tell
until I took thawed.'

702
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,200
‐ Did it happen here?
‐ Could've happened years ago.

703
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,366
'There's no way
to tell if the blood'

704
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,566
has been exposed to bacteria.

705
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,033
Oh, damn!

706
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,333
We should give it
to her anyway.

707
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,733
What, you want to make
her septic, too?

708
00:25:25,766 --> 00:25:27,766
No, Peter's right.
We can't transfuse.

709
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
So, now what?

710
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,700
Peter?

711
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,466
'I think we've arrived
at your desperate measures.'

712
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,466
No, no, no. I want to talk
to Detective Middleton.

713
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,666
Maybe he went home
for the day.

714
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,333
No, please don't
put me on hold.

715
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:42,200
You know, the cops
wouldn't have gotten this far.

716
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,800
How far have we gotten?
Uncle Joey?

717
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,733
These kinds of people
don't talk to the cops.

718
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,133
Where did you learn that?
Detective school?

719
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,433
We're close.
We saw him.

720
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,166
I know, I know. I don't want
to blow it either

721
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,466
but you got to know
when to ask for help.

722
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,333
Hi, yeah.

723
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,233
No, I don't know
if it's technically considered

724
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:57,566
an active case.

725
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,500
Hello? Hello?

726
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:01,166
‐ That might be him‐‐
‐ Hi. Yeah, I got you.

727
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,566
No, no, I said I don't know
if it's considered an act..

728
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,766
Hello? Hello?
I just charged this battery.

729
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,266
Joey!

730
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,166
Joey?

731
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,100
‐ Who's asking?
‐ We're not the cops.

732
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:14,433
'Course not. I already
got you made for the FBI.

733
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:16,166
We're looking
for your nephew.

734
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,700
His daughter's in the hospital
in critical condition.

735
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,300
We need his blood
to transfuse her.

736
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,466
‐ Whose blood?
‐ Keith Nelson, your nephew.

737
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,333
Keith Nelson's not my nephew.
Everybody calls me Uncle Joey.

738
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,433
‐ But you know him?
‐ Yeah, he's a good guy.

739
00:26:27,466 --> 00:26:28,466
You know where
we could find him?

740
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,566
No.

741
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
When's the last
time you saw him?

742
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,400
Uh, a couple weeks ago.

743
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,733
We almost beat the rams.

744
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,600
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

745
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,166
It's really important.

746
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
What's today? Thursday?

747
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:40,133
Well, sometimes he goes
to the cockfights.

748
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,333
‐ Cockfights?
‐ Yeah.

749
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,400
You know, two roosters

750
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,633
pecking each other to death.

751
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,766
Where?

752
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,300
Used to be
on the South side.

753
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,100
‐ I stopped going.
‐ You got an address?

754
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:49,466
No.

755
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,466
I could draw you a map.

756
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,433
Okay, linea alba
is incised.

757
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:54,766
Toothed forceps.

758
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,566
Metz.

759
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,166
‐ You ready, Peter?
‐ I hope so.

760
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,666
Be fast, huh?

761
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,566
She won't tolerate much more
than 100cc blood loss.

762
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,633
Go right
for the splenic artery.

763
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:06,733
Okay. Be standing by
with lap pads and suction.

764
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:08,533
BP 110/70.

765
00:27:08,566 --> 00:27:11,233
Let's keep it that way, Peter.

766
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,166
Alright.

767
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,533
Here we go.

768
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,733
Excellent.

769
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,600
Peritoneum looks dry.

770
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,166
Retractor.

771
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,700
Bovie.

772
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,200
Divide the gastro colic ligament

773
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,700
and we'll enter
the lesser sac.

774
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:28,066
Okay, got it.

775
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,400
Whoa! Whoa!
Suction, suction!

776
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:31,033
She's hemorrhaging!
Lets move.

777
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,166
Lap pad!

778
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,733
Released tamponade
on the hematoma.

779
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,433
‐ BP's falling.
‐ Vascular clamp.

780
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:36,466
Can you visualize
the spienic artery?

781
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,133
No.

782
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,700
What ever you do, don't
clamp off the pancreas.

783
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:41,466
Okay, suction, suction.
I can't see a damn thing.

784
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
Alright. Lose the clamp.
Compress it with your finger.

785
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:48,066
150cc blood loss so far.
Pressure's down... 70/50.

786
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,200
'Come on, come on.'

787
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:52,366
Damn. Come on.

788
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,533
Are you sure this is
the right place?

789
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,400
Yeah. The map says
it's across the bridge

790
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,566
and past the second
freight station.

791
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,700
What are you doing?
There's no one here.

792
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,466
They probably
don't advertise.

793
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,700
There's a light
on up there.

794
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,433
So, what, we're breaking
and entering now?

795
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,100
Unless you got
a better idea.

796
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,200
Not if you brought
bolt cutters.

797
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,200
No. I can give you a boost.

798
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:26,266
Like you said,
we're here.

799
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,066
Might as well check it out.

800
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,733
‐ There you go.
‐ Okay.

801
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:33,200
‐ There you go.
‐ I can't.

802
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,400
Yeah, you can.
I got you. Go ahead.

803
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:37,100
Up and over.

804
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,833
You got it.

805
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,366
There you go.
You did it.

806
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,466
How many fences
do they need?

807
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,566
You got to keep out
the riffraff.

808
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,033
You want to go back
and get your jacket

809
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,233
'cause it started
raining again?

810
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,600
No cars.

811
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,700
Do these people walk
to their cockfights?

812
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,433
I don't know
if I trust Uncle Joey.

813
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:01,700
He seemed too easy.

814
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,066
What, you quitting on me?

815
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,433
Hold up. Let's
check this out.

816
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,400
‐ Can I ask you something?
‐ Sure.

817
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,300
What made you decide
to come looking for Nelson?

818
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,333
Well, the girl needs help.

819
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,633
Yeah, but you see a lot
of people who need help.

820
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:18,433
'Whoo.'

821
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:20,200
Why'd you come out here?

822
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:21,800
‐ I don't know.
‐ Ooh.

823
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,466
I feel responsible.

824
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,300
It's not your fault, Lucy.

825
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,766
That's an easy thing to tell
yourself when things go wrong.

826
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,400
No, I shouldn't have made
you feel that way.

827
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,166
Truth is, you're the only
med student

828
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
I've had that's showed
any promise.

829
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:37,600
Do you see anything?

830
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,566
No, just a lot of dirt.

831
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,533
Hang on a sec.
I think I see something.

832
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:44,366
Hang on. What is that?
Is that a ring?

833
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,600
What kind of ring?

834
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,333
Carter!

835
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:50,166
Carter!

836
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,466
Oh, my God.

837
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,366
Are you okay?

838
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,300
‐ 'Dr. Carter, are you okay?'
‐ No.

839
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:58,433
Can you tell me your name?
Do you know your name?

840
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:00,533
I know my name, Lucy.

841
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,766
‐ I think I, um..
‐ What?

842
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,433
I think my shoulder.. I think I
dislocated my shoulder.

843
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:07,700
Are you sure?

844
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:10,500
Yeah. Anterior dislocation.

845
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,733
I don't think it's broken.

846
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,500
We got to get
you to the hospital.

847
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:16,233
Sensation's intact.

848
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,233
‐ And I got a pulse.
‐ Okay, you stay right there.

849
00:30:18,266 --> 00:30:19,266
I'm going to get some help.

850
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
No, wait, wait.

851
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:22,100
'That'll take forever.'

852
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,533
Can you move?

853
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:24,633
Can you get down?

854
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,100
Let's just do it here.

855
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,266
Yeah.

856
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,066
Okay. What?

857
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,433
Did we go over
shoulder reductions?

858
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,666
‐ No.
‐ We should've gone over that.

859
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,433
You did one that day, when you
weren't talking to me.

860
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,333
Alright, you're gonna pull
my arm..

861
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:38,066
'...really hard.'

862
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,133
‐ Yeah.
‐ Until you hear it pop.

863
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:42,066
‐ Just like that?
‐ I hope so.

864
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,566
‐ Isn't that gonna hurt?
‐ Oh, yeah.

865
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,733
Okay.

866
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:48,400
Ready?

867
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,066
Just commit to it.
Pull hard.

868
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
Two, three.

869
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,300
‐ Stop!
‐ What? What? What did I do?

870
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,333
I'm sorry.

871
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

872
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,133
I'm sorry.

873
00:31:02,066 --> 00:31:04,400
‐ We need countertraction.
‐ Okay.

874
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:07,700
Alright, I know.

875
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,700
Alright, stick
your foot in my pit.

876
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,500
‐ What?
‐ My armpit.

877
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:12,533
Your armpit?

878
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:13,566
'Just be
very careful.'

879
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
You said commit.

880
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:17,366
That's right.

881
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,733
Are you sure about this?

882
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,666
‐ One‐‐
‐ Just do it.

883
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,200
Two, three.

884
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:28,200
BP's up to 100/80
with saline.

885
00:31:28,233 --> 00:31:29,766
Alright,
the distal clamp is on.

886
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,500
Now, let go with your
finger, Peter, slowly.

887
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:35,600
Okay. It's looking pretty good.
Dry as a bone.

888
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,266
Crit's down to 12.

889
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,533
No further bleeding.

890
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:41,366
Kids can tolerate low crit.

891
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
PVC's?

892
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,433
What's her potassium?

893
00:31:44,466 --> 00:31:46,100
Uh... 4.2 pre‐op.

894
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,466
‐ Run of five.
‐ Lidocaine, 30 milligrams, IV.

895
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,000
‐ What is it?
‐ Could be cardiac ischemia.

896
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,533
V‐tach.

897
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,400
No pulse.

898
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,166
Alright, bring in
the crash cart.

899
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,666
Come on. Charge it to 80.
Hurry up. Crit's too low.

900
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,333
She's not getting
enough oxygen to the heart.

901
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,600
Here we go. Clear.

902
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,200
‐ Still V‐tach.
‐ Charge it to 160.

903
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,500
Clear.

904
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,066
Should've just
let you jump the fence

905
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,533
and drive the jeep around.

906
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,333
Do you think Uncle Joey
had the wrong night

907
00:32:24,366 --> 00:32:25,633
or he was just
pulling our leg?

908
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,600
I don't know. Maybe we should
double back.

909
00:32:27,633 --> 00:32:30,333
There's a light up there.

910
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:34,033
John..
Dr. Carter.

911
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:36,166
I just want you to know
that I do respect‐‐

912
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Ow!

913
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,033
I'm sorry.
I'm so..

914
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,033
I'm sorry.

915
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:48,066
That I do respect you and that
you're a good teacher.

916
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,100
And you must be a good person

917
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:54,033
otherwise you wouldn't
be out here.

918
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:57,366
And I'm sorry,
I'm so stubborn sometimes.

919
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,633
Stubborn can be good.

920
00:32:58,666 --> 00:32:59,766
Not when it's defensive.

921
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,166
Got us out here,
didn't it?

922
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,633
Is that good?

923
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,633
Most people would have given up
a long time ago.

924
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,200
In fact, most people
would never have gone looking.

925
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,500
I might have given up
if you hadn't come.

926
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:13,066
‐ Thanks for coming.
‐ Well, I didn't come for you.

927
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
‐ I came for the patient.
‐ No, I appreciate it.

928
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:16,033
It was very valiant of you.

929
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:17,400
No, really? They didn't
need me at the hospital.

930
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:19,066
I wanted something to do.

931
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,633
Well, you just said that
you came because I was stubborn.

932
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,466
I meant, we were stubborn.

933
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:27,000
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

934
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:33,166
'I am so sorry.'

935
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,733
My jeep.

936
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:45,024
It didn't look that
far from the bridge.

937
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,991
Indiana didn't look
that far from the bridge.

938
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,991
‐ Are you cold?
‐ I'm starving.

939
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:51,091
Hey, let's grab
something to eat.

940
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:53,357
I'm going to call a cab first.
Sometimes they take a while.

941
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:55,524
‐ If they come out here.
‐ Someone's on the phone.

942
00:33:55,557 --> 00:33:57,491
We're out in the middle
of nowhere.

943
00:33:57,524 --> 00:34:00,224
Middle of nowhere is the other
side of the skyway.

944
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,257
‐ Sorry.
‐ I'm going to order.

945
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:03,491
Okay, make it quick.

946
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:05,457
‐ Cheeseburger quick enough?
‐ Get it to go.

947
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,957
Honey, everything's to go.

948
00:34:06,991 --> 00:34:08,624
Uh, let me have
two cheeseburgers

949
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:11,124
and...two orders of fries.

950
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,157
No fries for me.

951
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,491
That was my order.

952
00:34:13,524 --> 00:34:15,624
Would you like
something?

953
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,391
Yeah. A cheeseburger.

954
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,424
Another
cheeseburger.

955
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,957
Long day?

956
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:23,157
You might say that, yeah.

957
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,957
'So, I'm going
to call a cab'

958
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:26,624
and then check with the hospital

959
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:29,224
and then I thought
that we might call Toby.

960
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:30,691
Toby, yeah.
He was real helpful.

961
00:34:30,724 --> 00:34:32,357
He said he'd think about it.

962
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,024
He'll probably deny
ever even knowing the guy.

963
00:34:35,057 --> 00:34:36,591
So, what do you want us to do?

964
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:40,291
‐ You want me to say it first?
‐ What?

965
00:34:41,724 --> 00:34:44,291
We're never gonna
find this guy.

966
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:46,224
There's gotta be
some other place we can try.

967
00:34:46,257 --> 00:34:48,324
Yeah, there are millions
of places we could try.

968
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:49,191
That's the problem.

969
00:34:52,024 --> 00:34:53,524
Let's just hope
they found that blood.

970
00:34:53,557 --> 00:34:56,157
‐ I'm calling the hospital.
‐ Get a cab first.

971
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:58,457
Want anything to drink
with that?

972
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,424
‐ Yeah, let me have a coke.
‐ Anything for the boss?

973
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:03,557
‐ Who?
‐ The boss. The missus.

974
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,257
Your girlfriend?

975
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,324
No. Not my girlfriend.

976
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:12,424
'John.'

977
00:35:12,457 --> 00:35:14,291
Come here.
Come here.

978
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:16,224
‐ What?
‐ Come here.

979
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,357
Whatever you say, pal.

980
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:23,557
Toby got an address on Nelson.

981
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,224
Toby. You just called Toby?
I thought we just decided‐‐

982
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,524
I wasn't gonna
argue with you.

983
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,091
You got an address?

984
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,191
I hear you had
a scare in the OR.

985
00:35:45,224 --> 00:35:46,591
I thought
she'd be gone by now.

986
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:49,224
I just wanted to check
on her before I left.

987
00:35:49,257 --> 00:35:51,357
Well, she's going
into renal failure

988
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,957
but she's too unstable
for dialysis.

989
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:55,991
She had arrhythmias
on lidocaine

990
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,157
and she had
a breakthrough seizure.

991
00:35:58,191 --> 00:36:00,224
It's a miracle you got
her through the surgery.

992
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:01,524
Yeah, we know
it won't do any good

993
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:03,924
if she can't have
a simple blood transfusion.

994
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,957
Now I get to stand around
and watch her die.

995
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:12,191
You want me to
talk to the mom?

996
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:16,124
Yeah.

997
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,324
Okay.

998
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,191
Good job, Peter.

999
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:30,357
Yeah.

1000
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,424
This is the address?

1001
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:39,524
Toby said this
is where he gets his mail.

1002
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:41,024
What is he, a hobo?

1003
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:42,457
So, this must be
his trailer.

1004
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,491
Do you see anything?

1005
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,157
Just five minutes.

1006
00:36:45,191 --> 00:36:46,457
I'm done peeking
through windows.

1007
00:36:48,257 --> 00:36:50,157
I can't believe Benton
operated without blood.

1008
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,057
That's what
the OR nurse said.

1009
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:53,057
That's a good sign, right?

1010
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,291
Nah. She still needs it.

1011
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,191
Mr. Nelson!

1012
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:00,157
Mr. Nelson,
are you in there?

1013
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:04,391
Should we go in?

1014
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,391
If he was leaving town, why
would he leave his trailer open?

1015
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:09,957
Depends on what kinda hurry
he was in.

1016
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,091
So we should
find something.

1017
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:11,891
Make sure this
is his place.

1018
00:37:13,324 --> 00:37:14,957
Looks like they had eggs
for breakfast.

1019
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,557
Are these
racing forms?

1020
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:20,191
Ah, these don't look like
construction plans.

1021
00:37:20,224 --> 00:37:22,224
What kind of guy
brings a kid to a train yard?

1022
00:37:22,257 --> 00:37:23,624
Well, maybe he had
nowhere else to take her.

1023
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,324
Could have left her
at home with her mother.

1024
00:37:27,357 --> 00:37:28,491
We don't know
the whole story.

1025
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:29,957
We know he walked out
on her.

1026
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:31,224
Well, in his mind,
he gave her up

1027
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:32,391
so she could get treatment.

1028
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,524
He didn't know
how bad off she was.

1029
00:37:33,557 --> 00:37:34,557
I don't care.

1030
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:36,091
You stick around
for your kids.

1031
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:37,324
Sometimes it's not
that simple.

1032
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,657
I never even met my dad.

1033
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,924
He was 19 years old
when I was born.

1034
00:37:42,957 --> 00:37:45,091
Probably thought
he'd screw it up.

1035
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,524
Might have been the best thing
for me and my mom.

1036
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,257
I'm sorry.

1037
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,324
Didn't mean to get personal.

1038
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:51,357
No, I'm just saying sometimes

1039
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:52,557
love can be complicated.

1040
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,124
I'll give you that.

1041
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:56,157
There's a message here.

1042
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,457
'Let's hope
it's a good one.'

1043
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,324
'Inga, are you there? Pick up.'

1044
00:38:01,357 --> 00:38:02,357
Yes.

1045
00:38:02,391 --> 00:38:03,424
'Okay, I don't know if you got'

1046
00:38:03,457 --> 00:38:04,624
'my message or if you been'

1047
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,657
'to the hospital yet.'

1048
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:07,024
'I'll try you again at work.'

1049
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:08,091
'I'm across the street.'

1050
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:09,124
'Call me on my cell phone.'

1051
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,257
Leave the number.

1052
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:11,357
'It's important.
It's about Corinna.'

1053
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,291
Leave the number.

1054
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,491
Damn it!

1055
00:38:14,524 --> 00:38:16,291
So, who's Inga?
His girlfriend?

1056
00:38:16,324 --> 00:38:17,524
It's across the street.

1057
00:38:17,557 --> 00:38:19,091
Across the street
from where?

1058
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,991
And what is she doing
at the hospital?

1059
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:24,291
Checking on his daughter.

1060
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:27,924
We find her,
we find Nelson.

1061
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:30,924
Randi? You talked to Randi?

1062
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:32,291
'Yeah, she said
she'd look for her.'

1063
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:33,691
That's alright,
we'll be there in five minutes.

1064
00:38:33,724 --> 00:38:35,391
More like eight.

1065
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:37,524
Listen, you take the ER
I'll take the ICU.

1066
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:38,691
And page if you find anything.

1067
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:39,924
Otherwise, we meet in the lobby.

1068
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:41,291
Right.

1069
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:42,691
Hey, you know your,
your fare's up to $84.

1070
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:44,191
Yeah.

1071
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,091
You two got enough cash
to cover this?

1072
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:48,157
‐ What do you have?
‐ I got 20. What about you?

1073
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,257
We're going to need
to stop at an ATM.

1074
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,324
Do we have to stop?
Can't we get

1075
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:51,924
some petty cash,
or something?

1076
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,357
Oh, wait. There's..

1077
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:55,257
There's one right across
the street from county.

1078
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,491
Where?

1079
00:38:56,524 --> 00:38:58,024
Across the street
by Doc Magoo's.

1080
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:00,924
Across the street..

1081
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:02,291
Nelson said
he was across the street.

1082
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:03,357
There was music playing
in the background.

1083
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,124
Do you think
he's at Doc Magoo's?

1084
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:18,324
‐ You see him?
‐ No.

1085
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,391
Excuse me.

1086
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:22,657
Excuse me.

1087
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,224
Have you seen a guy
in here mid '30s

1088
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:25,424
talking on a cell phone?

1089
00:39:25,457 --> 00:39:26,624
Every night.

1090
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:28,091
‐ John?
‐ Yeah?

1091
00:39:28,124 --> 00:39:29,491
Men's room?

1092
00:39:40,424 --> 00:39:41,957
'I want to see her.
Can I see her?'

1093
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:43,324
Soon as we get this started.
Just sit there

1094
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:44,557
and roll up
both of your sleeves.

1095
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,357
I can't believe
you found me.

1096
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:48,691
‐ No kidding, huh?
‐ Thank God. Thank you.

1097
00:39:48,724 --> 00:39:50,324
I was trying to get
some news.

1098
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,024
I didn't know
how bad she was.

1099
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,691
‐ Inga never called back?
‐ How do you know Inga?

1100
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,491
‐ From message your machine.
‐ You were in my trailer?

1101
00:39:55,524 --> 00:39:57,391
‐ We were everywhere.
‐ Got the donor bags.

1102
00:39:57,424 --> 00:39:58,457
I can't do this.

1103
00:39:58,491 --> 00:39:59,591
‐ Can you do this?
‐ Yup.

1104
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:01,324
'I‐I thought
she'd be okay.'

1105
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,691
Her mom could handle it.

1106
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:04,124
Dr. Greene's in sicu
with the girl.

1107
00:40:04,157 --> 00:40:05,191
I told them
you're coming.

1108
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:06,491
Try and get a BP.

1109
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:07,691
I didn't know
this could happen.

1110
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,324
I mean, how did I know
this could happen?

1111
00:40:09,357 --> 00:40:10,491
Got it.

1112
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:11,624
Hook it up.

1113
00:40:11,657 --> 00:40:13,457
I thought I was helping her.

1114
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:15,491
Hey, you're here now.

1115
00:40:15,524 --> 00:40:18,024
‐ The blood'll help, but‐‐
‐ I'll kill him.

1116
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:20,224
You can take his blood
and then I am gonna kill him.

1117
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:21,291
'Hey, we're coming
through there.'

1118
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:22,924
Get that gurney
out of the way.

1119
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,224
‐ Oh, thank God.
‐ Talk to me, Carter.

1120
00:40:24,257 --> 00:40:26,957
We found Mr. Nelson
next door at Doc Magoo's.

1121
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,657
One unit donated.
Another one filling.

1122
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,024
Alright. Has this been screened
for viruses?

1123
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:32,524
They tested the draw
from this morning. It's clean.

1124
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:34,957
Believe me, if I knew
there was a problem, I‐‐

1125
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,424
'Someone page Benton.'

1126
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,391
Kit, get this hung.

1127
00:40:38,424 --> 00:40:40,257
'Repeat a crit
in 30 minutes.'

1128
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,591
Check the phenobarb level.

1129
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,357
Corinna.

1130
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:45,224
'Corinna,
I'm here, sweetie.'

1131
00:40:45,257 --> 00:40:47,157
'ET Cuff's leaking.'

1132
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:49,024
I'll change it over a catheter.

1133
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:50,657
She's gonna be okay now, right?

1134
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:53,524
It's hard to say.

1135
00:40:53,557 --> 00:40:55,557
What she has is..

1136
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:57,357
...multi‐organ system failure.

1137
00:40:58,424 --> 00:40:59,391
What does that mean?

1138
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:02,591
She's been deprived of oxygen.

1139
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:03,924
'She's in a coma.'

1140
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:08,124
'It's been hard
to treat her seizures.'

1141
00:41:08,157 --> 00:41:12,357
'She has three
intravenous medications'

1142
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:14,424
'to stabilize
her heart rate'

1143
00:41:15,957 --> 00:41:17,924
'and, uh..'

1144
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,357
'...and her kidneys
have shut down.'

1145
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:22,057
But his blood
will make her better, right?

1146
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,257
A lot of damage has been done.

1147
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:53,091
Hey.

1148
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:55,191
Hey.

1149
00:41:56,691 --> 00:42:00,657
‐ You look like hell.
‐ Thanks. So do you.

1150
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:02,691
So, what is that,
a clavicle fracture?

1151
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:05,157
'Anterior dislocation.'

1152
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:06,691
Long story, right?

1153
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,024
Long story.

1154
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:09,524
Yeah.

1155
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:11,957
I better get out of here.
I'm on at 6:00.

1156
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:14,124
Hey, good job
keeping her alive.

1157
00:42:16,091 --> 00:42:18,091
Bloodless surgery.
That's a first time.

1158
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:23,091
You should put that shoulder
in an immobilizer.

1159
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:40,657
Hi.

1160
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:43,657
I thought you went home.

1161
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:46,957
No. We're on in an hour.

1162
00:42:46,991 --> 00:42:48,324
It's better not to sleep

1163
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,991
unless you can get
at least three.

1164
00:42:51,391 --> 00:42:52,991
I wouldn't sleep anyway.

1165
00:42:55,457 --> 00:42:56,891
Her crit's up three points.

1166
00:42:58,724 --> 00:43:01,091
'But the renal failure
may be permanent.'

1167
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:04,224
That's if she wakes up.

1168
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,957
I thought we were saving her.

1169
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:13,157
No.

1170
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,657
We were giving her,
her only chance.

1171
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:17,224
‐ That's not good enough.
‐ It has to be.

1172
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:18,224
No..

1173
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:22,324
...it doesn't.

1174
00:43:22,357 --> 00:43:24,924
Some patients get to
you more than others.

1175
00:43:24,957 --> 00:43:27,224
I know.

1176
00:43:27,257 --> 00:43:30,124
But when you do everything
that you can..

1177
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:33,124
Sometimes even more than
you thought you could..

1178
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:37,124
You gotta walk away knowing
you fought the good fight.

1179
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:43,924
You fought
the good fight, Lucy.

1180
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:53,424
Tomorrow, you'll
fight another one.
