1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,333
Previously on "ER"..

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:08,800
'I can't watch him..'

3
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,633
...suffer anymore.

4
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,300
'Help us, please.'

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,533
Mr. Abbott is accusing you
of murdering his son.

6
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,166
I gave the mother
the entry code.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,666
I showed her
how to change the dosage.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,533
'You don't need anybody else.'

9
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,600
You are a country unto yourself.

10
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:23,300
What the hell is wrong with you?

11
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,766
If you wanna destroy
your own career, that's fine.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,033
But you stay
the hell away from mine.

13
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:28,266
'We got a school bus
flipped over by a snowplow.'

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,500
Bunch of kids are trapped.

15
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,600
Firemen need
a doctor on the scene.

16
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,500
I'm going with you.

17
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:35,300
'Doug!'

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
Mom! Dad! Ow!

19
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:47,033
Mom! Dad!

20
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:49,600
'Mom! Dad!'

21
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,100
'Mom! Dad!'

22
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,366
Worst kids are up front.

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,166
They were coming home
from a ski trip.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Three of them were
trapped under the plow.

25
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,533
'Patient number three,
ten‐year‐old female'

26
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:02,700
'with closed head trauma.'

27
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,566
'Blown pupil,
altered mental status.'

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,333
'Left leg's pinned.
Pressure's 110 palp.'

29
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,500
'Breathing's labored.
Rate's 32.'

30
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,300
Alright. Tube and
hyperventilate her.

31
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,433
Notify County that we have
a possible intracranial bleed.

32
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:14,300
Have neurosurgery and CT
standing by. What do you got?

33
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,800
Patient number five, broken
left femur, foot's pulseless.

34
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:20,433
Yeah, mottled leg.
Poor cap refill.

35
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,266
‐ Can we move her?
‐ No. Seat has us wedged.

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,466
How do I get
to the rest of her?

37
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,600
‐ Up and around, doc.
‐ Alright.

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,100
Thank you.

39
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,800
'I want my mom!
Mom! Dad!'

40
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,266
‐ 'Calm down. It's okay.'
‐ 'Mom! Dad!'

41
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,733
‐ 'Your parents are on the way.'
‐ Mom, help!

42
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,533
Mom! Dad!

43
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,666
Is this the broken femur
from the other side?

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,433
Scrapes and bruises. Pressure's
100, resps 16.

45
00:01:56,466 --> 00:01:58,466
Gave her eight of morphine.

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,300
‐ Any bleeding under there?
‐ Not that I could see.

47
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,766
‐ Her name's JJ.
‐ Hi, JJ.

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,400
My name's Mark.
How are you feeling?

49
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,400
‐ I'm scared.
‐ 'I know you are.'

50
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,500
Just hang in there.

51
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,600
Listen, your leg is broken

52
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,300
'but I need you
to be brave for me.'

53
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,300
‐ Can you be brave?
‐ Okay.

54
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,566
Okay, good.

55
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,433
Alright, splint that
fracture as best you can

56
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:18,066
and throw another
blanket on her.

57
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,533
‐ How long has she been trapped?
‐ About 30 minutes.

58
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,433
‐ How much time have we got?
‐ How much time for what, guys?

59
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:24,366
‐ Till she loses her leg.
‐ Six hours.

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,733
‐ Any of the others trapped?
‐ Oh, yeah.

61
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:27,500
We got a boy
jammed between the seats

62
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,066
trapped underneath
the girl here.

63
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,366
We can hear the little guy
but we can't get to him.

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Take it easy, Dennis!

65
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,600
Got a kid in the back, doc.

66
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,633
'BP's 50 palp.'

67
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,466
He's not moving his legs.

68
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,800
Keep an eye on her vitals.

69
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,033
Let me know
if anything changes.

70
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:42,533
Could be lumbosacral plexus
injury with paralysis.

71
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:44,266
Have you been reading
the Rosen's again?

72
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,500
Taking the MCAT's
in a couple of weeks.

73
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,500
They popped the back.

74
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,133
'What the hell is that?'

75
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,066
'Crane.'

76
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,466
That ought to do it.

77
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,200
Dr. Anspaugh..

78
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,400
...may I speak with you
for a moment, please?

79
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,633
I have to finish my rounds.

80
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,100
You know that Dr. Romano
has closed the ER clinic?

81
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:10,633
You left us little choice.

82
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,233
‐ You can't do it.
‐ Listen, I am in a hurry.

83
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:16,566
If you wanna discuss this
further, call my office.

84
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,066
Set up an appointment.

85
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,733
Doctor, please..

86
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,466
I have worked here
for ten years

87
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,066
and this ER clinic
has made a real difference.

88
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Preventing people
from getting sick

89
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,066
helping them make better
choices in their lives.

90
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,133
I no longer trust your judgment.

91
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,600
So hundreds of patients
have to be punished

92
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,033
because of my mistake?

93
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:33,400
If this hospital
is required to pay

94
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,033
millions of dollars in damages

95
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,433
more than a few
hundred clinic patients

96
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,366
are gonna find themselves
without treatment.

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,700
Then I'll quit.
I'll quit.

98
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,266
I'll hand over
the clinic to someone else.

99
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,766
Someone you do trust.

100
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,366
But don't close it, please.

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Not because of me.

102
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,633
'Jeanie?'

103
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,233
'911 emergency'

104
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:10,400
I've been in an accident.
I've got a woman badly hurt.

105
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,433
I need help, please!

106
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:08,776
What's going on?

107
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,609
School bus got hit
by a snowplow.

108
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,143
Oh, man, I was hoping
for an easier night.

109
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:14,509
‐ How many?
‐ At least 15.

110
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:16,276
Uh, I should have
called in sick.

111
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,476
Good evening.
Good evening.

112
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,109
The board is up to date.

113
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,643
Dr. Doyle is waiting
for films in curtain three

114
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:24,809
the lab is late with blood
work for Weaver in exam four

115
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:27,409
there are seven waiting in
chairs and I am out of here.

116
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:28,709
Police are still in trauma.

117
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,343
I told them to be out
in five minutes.

118
00:05:30,376 --> 00:05:31,843
Jerry, where the hell
you think you're going?

119
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,343
I'm off at 7:30.

120
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,743
Hey, you're off
when I say you're off.

121
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,376
‐ Wait, is that nurses too?
‐ You betcha.

122
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,776
‐ Damn.
‐ Carter and Lucy?

123
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:39,309
In exam six.

124
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,109
Carter and Lucy,
what in exam six?

125
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,443
Uh, Rural Minnesota,
North Dakota..

126
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,843
In the middle of winter?

127
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,809
Yeah, well, you know,
it pays 4,000 a week.

128
00:05:46,843 --> 00:05:48,109
It sounds miserable.

129
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,209
Yeah, it sounds like tuition

130
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:50,676
and a tutor for reese to me.

131
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,076
Do we know
what's coming in first?

132
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,409
Blunt chest trauma,
traumatic amputation

133
00:05:54,443 --> 00:05:57,109
and a kid with a possible
spinal cord injury.

134
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:58,643
‐ All at once?
‐ Lovely.

135
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,143
I've gone through the files.

136
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,643
Medicine will take
the diabetics.

137
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,809
Said they could use them
on their teaching service.

138
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:10,109
OB's agreed to
look after the prenatals

139
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:11,243
once they hit
the third trimester.

140
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:12,476
The rest are on their own.

141
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:15,276
Anspaugh isn't
closing the clinic.

142
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,443
What?

143
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,343
He decided to keep it open.

144
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,443
Well, that's great news.

145
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,609
What did you have to do,
sell your firstborn?

146
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:26,243
‐ No, I had to quit.
‐ You're joking.

147
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,609
Well, I get to keep
my job in the ER

148
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,743
but I'm out of management.

149
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:32,743
So who‐who's gonna
run the clinic?

150
00:06:32,776 --> 00:06:35,743
‐ You are.
‐ Mm‐mm. No, no, no way.

151
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,609
I don't want that
kind of responsibility.

152
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:38,676
Tough.

153
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:40,809
Look, paperwork,
the fundraising

154
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:43,343
the endless crap from admit?
I've done it. No thanks.

155
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,709
Would you rather shut down
the clinic instead?

156
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:47,276
Carol, I'm bad at it.

157
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:49,609
I yell at the wrong people,
I piss everybody off.

158
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,409
I'll be around.
I'll help you out.

159
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,609
I mean, it's either that
or all these people

160
00:06:53,643 --> 00:06:56,209
have nowhere else to go.

161
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,576
Your choice.

162
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:01,209
‐ Oh, Chuny. Hi.
‐ Hi.

163
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,176
‐ You got a minute?
‐ Sure. What's up?

164
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,809
Um..

165
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:06,443
..earlier, with Lucy and I

166
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,209
I'm sure that
you have your suspicions

167
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,109
about what we were
doing in there

168
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:11,476
but actually, we were just‐‐

169
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,443
‐ Knocking boots?
‐ What?

170
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,743
Doing the old nasty?

171
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:16,743
Hey, the more
the merrier, I say.

172
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,109
Actually, we weren't
doing anything.

173
00:07:18,143 --> 00:07:19,276
Mm‐hmm.

174
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,143
I mean, she's
a med student, you know?

175
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:23,209
I'm a...resident.

176
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,743
That stuff happens all the time.

177
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:27,343
Lucy's like,
Lucy's like a little..

178
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:28,543
...sister or something to me.

179
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,076
Ah, you do that with
your little sister?

180
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,143
Nothing happened.
We didn't do anything.

181
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:32,276
Do you hear what
I'm telling you?

182
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:33,476
Besides, I already
have a girlfriend.

183
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,376
Ah, that insurance lady?

184
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,076
‐ She's a financial advisor.
‐ Mm.

185
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:39,443
Roxanne and I have
a lot in common.

186
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,143
'Units are pulling up!'

187
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:42,409
She's too pushy, you know?

188
00:07:42,443 --> 00:07:44,376
Always trying to
sell you something.

189
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,543
I'd stick with Lucy.

190
00:07:45,576 --> 00:07:46,743
You two make a cute couple.

191
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,843
We are not a couple!

192
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,743
Maggie, Elizabeth,
take the first one.

193
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,143
Carter, Lucy,
you're on three.

194
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,143
'Peter, you come with me!'

195
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,376
Ten‐year‐old female.

196
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:56,143
Traumatic amputation
below the left wrist.

197
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:58,409
BP 90/60,
heart rate 120.

198
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:00,776
‐ Lost 500cc's of blood.
‐ Do you have the hand?

199
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:02,743
'They're still looking for it
at the accident site.'

200
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:04,409
Nine‐year‐old boy
who was sitting backwards

201
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,843
slammed into the edge of
the metal seat in front of him.

202
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,409
He's not moving his legs.

203
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,443
Resps 16,
BP's down to 70/40.

204
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:10,676
Could be a lumbar fracture.

205
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,209
What about spinal shock
with that low BP?

206
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,376
Internal bleeding more likely.

207
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,709
Alright,
let's round up an ultrasound.

208
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,543
11‐year‐old female,
blunt chest trauma

209
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,309
decreased breath
sounds on the left.

210
00:08:18,343 --> 00:08:20,176
‐ BP's 80/40.
‐ Pneumothorax?

211
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,343
Or a hemopneumothorax.

212
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,743
‐ I need an ultrasound!
‐ X‐ray!

213
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:24,543
Trauma two!
Maggie, trauma one!

214
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:25,843
Carter, take exam two!

215
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:28,309
This way. Tear it down!

216
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,076
Just tear it down!
Let's go!

217
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,609
‐ This is a crime scene!
‐ Not anymore. It's not.

218
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,509
Let's clear this
crap out of here.

219
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:36,143
Abdomen's soft.
Decreased bowel sounds.

220
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:39,076
Okay, no reflexes
below the waist.

221
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,843
Let's get a cross‐table
lumbar and hang steroids.

222
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,109
‐ Get out. Go!
‐ What happened in here?

223
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,309
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

224
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:47,109
I'm so cold.

225
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,076
Carol, check up on
the other patients.

226
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,276
BP's 80/50.

227
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:54,476
She's got a strong
brachial pulse.

228
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:56,076
Get me another BP cuff.

229
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:59,576
Okay, the amputation is distal

230
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:01,409
to the radius and the ulna.

231
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:03,809
‐ 'I'll clamp that bleeder.'
‐ How you doing?

232
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,576
‐ Peachy.
‐ Can you save it?

233
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:08,243
Well, if they find the hand,
maybe we've got a chance.

234
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,443
‐ Pulse ox down to 88.
‐ You doing okay?

235
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:13,709
Uh, she dropped her sats

236
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,709
and her respiratory
effort's getting worse.

237
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:17,209
‐ Where's that portable X‐ray?
‐ Corday's got it.

238
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:18,209
Can't wait.

239
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:19,509
Let's get a chest tube tray

240
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:21,509
and Lucy, palpate
the fifth intercostal space.

241
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,609
‐ Like this?
‐ Yeah, that's right.

242
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,709
Now incise with a scalpel.

243
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:28,143
Spread with a kelly,
insert your finger.

244
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,643
‐ Oh, my God, what is that?
‐ What?

245
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:32,776
Bag for me.

246
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,376
That's intestine.

247
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,476
Did I make the incision too low?

248
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,109
No, the diaphragm's ruptured.

249
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,576
The force of the impact must
have pushed everything up.

250
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,409
'Let's call the OR, right now.'

251
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,243
‐ No free fluid in the belly.
‐ 'Everyone's alright.'

252
00:09:50,276 --> 00:09:52,609
Carter's got ruptured diaphragm.
Corday called vascular.

253
00:09:52,643 --> 00:09:54,309
There's two more
ambulances coming in.

254
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,776
Both patients are stable
with multiple lacerations

255
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,209
and possible
extremity fractures.

256
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,209
'Foley cath is in.'

257
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:00,343
'Let me know when they arrive.'

258
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:01,809
Have Jeanie start
suturing the lacs.

259
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:03,509
‐ Jeanie's not around.
‐ Where is she?

260
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:04,509
‐ I don't know.
‐ I can find Doug.

261
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:05,809
‐ He can do it.
‐ No.

262
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:07,409
‐ It's just lacerations‐‐
‐ I said no.

263
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,243
Alright,
he's got gross hematuria.

264
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,576
Let's prep for a one‐shot IVP.

265
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:12,843
Call CT. Let's move.

266
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:15,076
Jerry, find Jeanie.
We need her.

267
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:16,209
‐ Find her how?
‐ I don't know.

268
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,176
Just find her.

269
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:23,509
'Come on!'

270
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:24,843
Let's go!

271
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:27,076
Come on!

272
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,476
I got a woman in the car.

273
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,643
Come on. Yeah, I need gloves.

274
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:33,076
I need gloves.
I'm a doctor.

275
00:10:33,109 --> 00:10:35,676
I got a woman.
She's got multiple lacerations.

276
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:37,809
‐ She's HIV‐positive.
‐ What happened?

277
00:10:37,843 --> 00:10:39,509
I slid on the ice.

278
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:42,309
She's unconscious.

279
00:10:42,343 --> 00:10:44,609
'Lost control. She wasn't
wearing her seat belt.'

280
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:46,476
'Hang on, hang on.'

281
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:49,409
Jeanie?

282
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,843
Alright.

283
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,443
'I got it.'

284
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:55,543
Alright, Jeanie.

285
00:10:55,576 --> 00:10:58,309
Nice and easy. Okay.

286
00:10:58,343 --> 00:10:59,843
Jeanie? Give me your penlight.

287
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,609
‐ You got a light?
‐ Yeah. Right here.

288
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:03,743
Good carotid.

289
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,176
No step off.

290
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,509
Multiple lacerations.

291
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,343
Pupils are..

292
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:14,743
...equal and reactive.

293
00:11:14,776 --> 00:11:16,409
‐ Oh, we need to transport her.
‐ Come on. Let's go.

294
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:19,643
Hang in there,
Jeanie, hang in there.

295
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:20,643
'That thing is too unstable.'

296
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:21,643
If I start lifting

297
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:22,809
the weight may shift forward

298
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,376
crush everything
underneath that blade.

299
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,643
Well, how about
attaching it to the front?

300
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:27,176
I don't know.
I can't go in there.

301
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,509
I could take that
whole chassis with me.

302
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,743
We just need
the weight lifted off

303
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,543
so that we can
pull the kids out.

304
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:33,443
I've got railroad
ties on the truck.

305
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:35,309
Maybe we can put
some under the chassis.

306
00:11:35,343 --> 00:11:36,309
Take some of
the weight off the blade

307
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,709
put it back onto the truck.

308
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,309
Well, let's do it.
Boys, we need some muscle.

309
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:43,209
Doc! I found the hand.

310
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,276
One of the fingers
is pretty smashed up

311
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,576
but otherwise it's okay.

312
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,476
Alright, just pack it
in saline gauze with ice

313
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,676
and get it to County.

314
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,276
How's she doing?

315
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,376
She's calmer, but she's
still in a lot of pain, doc.

316
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:55,643
Hang in there, JJ.
We'll get you out.

317
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,076
‐ It hurts.
‐ Yeah.

318
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:58,776
‐ How much morphine has she had?
‐ 20 migs.

319
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,676
Respiratory rate's down
but she's still moaning.

320
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,743
Alright, give her another five.
Keep an eye on her breathing.

321
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:04,276
The trapped little boy
stopped talking.

322
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,443
‐ When?
‐ Couple of minutes ago.

323
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:07,509
Hey, Dennis, Dennis,
can you hear me?

324
00:12:09,176 --> 00:12:10,543
Alright,
we're running out of time.

325
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:12,343
‐ Tell them we got to go.
‐ Under the front!

326
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:14,543
‐ One more!
‐ What's all the noise?

327
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:16,376
We're just trying
to get you out, okay?

328
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,209
‐ I got it.
‐ 'Alright, we're ready.'

329
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,609
‐ Everybody out.
‐ I'm not comin'.

330
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:23,409
‐ The hell you're not.
‐ I'm stayin' here.

331
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,343
Go on. Get out. Go, go, go.

332
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,709
It's alright.

333
00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:28,709
Here, doc.

334
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:32,743
Don't worry, darling.

335
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,176
I'm right here with you.

336
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,243
Okay, doc. Let's go.

337
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:39,143
‐ Take it up.
‐ Okay, don't worry.

338
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,809
Don't worry.
I'm right here.

339
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,243
It's gonna be
a little loud, okay?

340
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:45,576
‐ Just relax.
‐ 'Here we go, up!'

341
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,476
Up.

342
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,076
It's okay, JJ.
It's almost over.

343
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,643
‐ That's it. It's free.
‐ Alright. Let's go.

344
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:07,109
Okay, I need somebody to guide
the leg on the other side.

345
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,743
'I got it.'

346
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:11,109
‐ 'Whoa. We got a pumper.'
‐ 'I'm on it.'

347
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:13,609
'Watch the femur.
Unstable open fracture.'

348
00:13:13,643 --> 00:13:16,276
Careful, careful.

349
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,543
'Apply a pressure dressing'

350
00:13:17,576 --> 00:13:19,476
and get a hare
traction on that leg.

351
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,309
‐ Let's find the boy.
‐ I got him! I got him!

352
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:29,509
‐ Is he breathing?
‐ Resps about 16 and shallow.

353
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,343
He's got multiple lacerations.

354
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:33,576
A possible fracture
of the right forearm.

355
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,276
We found the boy.
He's still alive.

356
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,576
‐ Can you get him out?
‐ We need a backboard.

357
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,309
'You'll never be able
to move around in there.'

358
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:41,443
We'll cut in from the outside.

359
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,609
'Doc, we need you out here.'

360
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:47,243
‐ I got him. Go, go!
‐ 'The leg's a mess.'

361
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,576
She's still losing
a lot of blood.

362
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:51,743
Pump up a BP cuff
proximal to the fracture

363
00:13:51,776 --> 00:13:53,843
and clamp it off
with a hemostat.

364
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,209
That ought to hold her
till she gets to the ER.

365
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,509
Have ortho and
vascular standing by

366
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,743
ready to do an angiogram.

367
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:03,576
Tell them we don't
have much time.

368
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,343
Are you coming with me?

369
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,543
I'll meet you there, okay, JJ?

370
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,209
‐ Okay.
‐ Alright.

371
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,776
BP's 90/60, pulse 120.

372
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:17,609
Large contusions over
both upper quadrants.

373
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:20,376
Okay, we need to evaluate
for a splenic rupture.

374
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,476
Start two lines and
then transport him.

375
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,176
The twos and threes
have all been transported.

376
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,743
All we have left are minors.

377
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:28,309
Alright, get the other kids
to us as soon as you can.

378
00:14:28,343 --> 00:14:30,643
‐ Good work, skipper.
‐ Thanks, doc.

379
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:44,109
‐ What?
‐ They're all alive.

380
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:46,109
So far.

381
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,309
David Martino.

382
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:58,809
M‐A‐R‐T‐I‐N‐O.

383
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,676
The police told us that our
daughter was brought in here.

384
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,309
Please, look, everyone,
I know that you're worried

385
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:04,776
but yelling at me
isn't gonna to help.

386
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,376
I need your name,
I need your child's name so‐‐

387
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:08,843
Blunt trauma to the abdomen.

388
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:11,209
Temporary response to
crystalloids in the field.

389
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,576
He just dropped
his pressure again.

390
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:14,843
Dennis? That's my son!
Dennis, you alright?

391
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:17,209
He was trapped, okay?
He's stable now.

392
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:19,476
We need to take him for
further evaluation and tests.

393
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,809
What do you mean?
What kind of tests?

394
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:22,643
Sir, you're gonna
have to wait outside, okay?

395
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:24,609
We are gonna find you
as soon as we know more.

396
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,409
Yeah. But he's gonna
be alright, right?

397
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,176
Can you help
this gentleman, please?

398
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,743
Come on, let the doctors
do their work, sir.

399
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,109
He's shocky.
Could be a spleen injury.

400
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,109
He'll need
an ultrasound or a DPL.

401
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,343
How are the rest?

402
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,743
Amputation's
already up in the OR.

403
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:41,543
‐ Has the hand made it?
‐ Yup. One, two, three.

404
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:43,543
Anspaugh took
the fractured kidney upstairs.

405
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,143
Romano and Edson got
the ruptured diaphragm.

406
00:15:47,176 --> 00:15:49,443
Type and cross for six.
Get a stat H&H.

407
00:15:49,476 --> 00:15:52,509
BP's 80/60, pulse 120.

408
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,576
How about the girl
with the pulseless foot?

409
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,709
Corday's got her.
She's prepping for an angiogram.

410
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:59,643
Connie, can you see
if CT can take another one?

411
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:02,076
‐ No seat belts on the bus?
‐ Nope.

412
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:04,143
'Air bags in
every new car in America'

413
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:07,409
but we send our children off
like lambs to the slaughter.

414
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,409
You're a mess.
Why don't you get cleaned up?

415
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:11,176
Great. Thanks.

416
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:16,143
'Out of the way!
Out of the way!'

417
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,143
‐ How's she doing?
‐ Big subdural on CT.

418
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:20,776
Neurosurgery's waiting.
Let's go!

419
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,276
September 5, 1989.

420
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,276
Mark, hypothermic
boy's coming in.

421
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:27,509
I'll be right back out.

422
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:29,709
‐ Somebody order four pizzas?
‐ Yeah.

423
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:31,176
'Forty two, fifty.'

424
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,709
Bus driver's
admitted to cardiology.

425
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,843
I'll take
the eye injury in exam one.

426
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,576
This is County General,
come in, 29.

427
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:38,443
I got a kid that's gonna need
50 stitches. Where's Lucy?

428
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:41,509
Uh, she's in surgery with Edson
on that ruptured diaphragm.

429
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,176
‐ What about Jeanie?
‐ Still AWOL.

430
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,276
Call somebody upstairs
that can sew

431
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,609
and get their ass down here.

432
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:47,176
‐ Who else is coming in?
‐ Uh, hypothermic kid‐‐

433
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:48,743
‐ I'll take him.
‐ Two minutes out.

434
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,176
Found him in the snow,
20 yards from the wreck.

435
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,309
Must have been thrown by
the force of the collision.

436
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:56,443
Blunt abdominal trauma,
no obvious head injury

437
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:58,443
BP 70 palp, pulse 40.

438
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,443
His name, Anthony Martino,
was written inside his jacket.

439
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:04,576
‐ He's throwing PVCs.
‐ Must have irritated his heart.

440
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,576
Prep for
a warm peritoneal lavage.

441
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:11,509
How's she doing?

442
00:17:11,543 --> 00:17:14,176
Angiogram showed
a partial tear in the popliteal.

443
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,609
I reduced her fracture,
got back a weak pulse.

444
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,576
There's good
collateral circulation.

445
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,543
We've bought
vascular a little time.

446
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,243
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

447
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,576
I see you still have
your fireman's hat.

448
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,843
Is my mom here?

449
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,276
I'm not sure,
but I'll go find out.

450
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,609
‐ What's your last name?
‐ Mitchell.

451
00:17:32,643 --> 00:17:35,176
I'll find her
if she's here, JJ.

452
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:39,076
How long till
they take her upstairs?

453
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,576
They're handling
life threats first.

454
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,109
Limb threats are stacked up.

455
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,643
It's been
three and a half hours.

456
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,409
You know, if they don't
get to her in the next hour

457
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,809
I'll start calling around
see if we can transport her

458
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:47,843
somewhere else.

459
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:51,343
Don't wait. Call now.

460
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:53,643
OR's backed up. Some on‐call
surgeons can't make it in.

461
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:55,443
Yeah, he can't wait.
You take him.

462
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:58,276
‐ What's up?
‐ DPL's positive. He's going up.

463
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:00,709
Call the blood bank on
that cross‐matched blood.

464
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:02,109
‐ Dr. Greene?
‐ Liver?

465
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:03,709
‐ 'His spleen.'
‐ Kerry, core temp's 84.

466
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,109
DPL's grossly positive.

467
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,143
Did you give him
warmed intra‐abdominal?

468
00:18:06,176 --> 00:18:07,376
Warmed gastric
lavage is going.

469
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:08,809
I held up on
the peritoneal lavage.

470
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:10,476
I didn't want to dislodge
a clot in his liver.

471
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,509
Start the bladder re‐warming.
I'll be right in.

472
00:18:12,543 --> 00:18:14,709
‐ More vent.
‐ Dr. Greene?

473
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:16,143
Mark, paramedics comin' in hot.

474
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:17,343
‐ Kid crumped in the rig.
‐ From the bus?

475
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:19,109
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay, clear a trauma room now.

476
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:21,443
Okay, I'm gonna go, check on
Carter's hypothermic kid.

477
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,076
‐ Dr. Greene?
‐ What?

478
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,709
Kobe Ikabo. You talked
to my husband, Mobalage.

479
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:28,343
Yeah, of course, I'm sorry,
it's a little hectic now.

480
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:30,243
We went to see the doctor

481
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,209
and Mobalage has been scheduled
to have the surgery tomorrow.

482
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:35,543
Connie, can you see if there's
someone here for a JJ Mitchell?

483
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:36,743
Hey, Carol, do
you got a minute?

484
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,709
Yeah, what's up?

485
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,609
‐ I'm sorry. What?
‐ Um, the surgery.

486
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,476
I think it might be a mistake.

487
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,709
‐ Why?
‐ Does he need it?

488
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:49,509
‐ If he wants to get better.
‐ Does he need to get better?

489
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,143
‐ Oh, God.
‐ Carol! Carol!

490
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,676
Ms. Ikabo, it's normal for you

491
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,676
to have anxiety
before a surgery.

492
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,643
There's always some risk,
but in your husband's case

493
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:01,709
it's minimal.
He should regain full function.

494
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:04,243
‐ Hey, we need a hand!
‐ Which one is it?

495
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,509
Patient number 13.

496
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:07,443
Broken ribs,
minor head injuries.

497
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,309
‐ I thought she was stable.
‐ She crashed en route.

498
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,776
'Sinus on the scope, no vitals.'

499
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,476
Tubed her,
but I couldn't find a line.

500
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:14,576
‐ Okay, how long?
‐ 'Eight minutes.'

501
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,209
Let's go, darling.
Here we go.

502
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,443
Pupils mid‐range and sluggish.
Jerry, where are we?

503
00:19:26,476 --> 00:19:28,576
Uh, pedes clinic. Best I can do.

504
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:29,709
Dr. Greene?

505
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:31,709
Mrs. Ikabo,
I can't talk right now.

506
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:33,643
Look, wait in chairs.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

507
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:35,143
No pulse without CPR.

508
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:36,476
‐ Last epi?
‐ Three minutes.

509
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,709
Alright. Another amp
down the ET tube.

510
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,276
Malik, what happened to Carol?

511
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,843
Doug and Jeanie crashed
head‐on into an overpass.

512
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,243
Doug's alright, Jeanie's hurt.

513
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:43,543
Unit 29's pulling in
with them right now.

514
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:46,776
Mark, we're here.

515
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,276
Vitals are stable, contusions
of face, forehead and abdomen.

516
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:52,843
‐ Precautions, everyone.
‐ BP's 130/94, pulse ox 98.

517
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,176
She came to a few minutes ago.

518
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:55,476
Jeanie, do you know
what day it is?

519
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,476
‐ Thursday.
‐ Doug, are you okay?

520
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:57,476
She lost consciousness.

521
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,476
Trachea midline

522
00:19:58,509 --> 00:19:59,543
no apparent chest injuries.

523
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:00,576
She wasn't wearing a seat belt.

524
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:03,076
'Stupid, huh?'

525
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,276
Doug, let me look at your head.

526
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,643
We need a CT and a trauma panel.

527
00:20:05,676 --> 00:20:06,776
Doug, we got it. Back off.

528
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,143
You're guarding, tenderness

529
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:09,509
in the right upper quadrant.

530
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,676
‐ Get a CT.
‐ Everybody get back to work!

531
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,676
‐ Get out of there, Doug.
‐ Dr. Ross, step back!

532
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,076
She could have a liver injury.

533
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,243
Yeah, we'll catch it
if she does.

534
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:17,743
Carol..

535
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:19,309
...Carter's hypothermic
ten‐year‐old's in trouble.

536
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,509
‐ Okay, Peter, you got her?
‐ Yeah.

537
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:21,776
Jeanie, I'll come back
as soon as I can.

538
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:22,776
Kerry, Kerry,
look, I'll take Carter

539
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:23,776
you stay here with Jeanie.

540
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:25,543
No, I will take Carter.

541
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,709
‐ It's a pedes case.
‐ You are off this station!

542
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,609
You are not working
in this hospital! Not tonight!

543
00:20:30,643 --> 00:20:33,143
Now sit down and
let Carol look at your head!

544
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:40,209
Alright, no peritoneal signs.

545
00:20:40,243 --> 00:20:41,476
Let's get the, uh, trauma panel.

546
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:42,643
‐ Come on.
‐ Move.

547
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:46,409
Get a CT on the head
and, uh, a belly.

548
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,509
Get the O‐neg!

549
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,643
We're actively re‐warming
with foley, NG and ET.

550
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:54,509
But he's still
hypothermic at 84 degrees.

551
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:57,176
‐ Okay, what do you suggest?
‐ Cardiac bypass.

552
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,543
Heart rate's down
to 30, BP's 60 palp.

553
00:20:59,576 --> 00:21:03,143
‐ He's soaked.
‐ Oh. Oh, God. Conductive loss.

554
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,409
Let's get these
wet clothes off of him.

555
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:05,443
You're headed
in the right direction.

556
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:07,443
No bypass, just keep warming.

557
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,509
Lily, notify the OR. They've
got another ex‐lap pending.

558
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:13,609
‐ What if he goes into V‐fib?
‐ He won't make it to the OR.

559
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:16,643
Mark, Mark, I couldn't find
anybody for a JJ Mitchell.

560
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,609
You want me to see if we
have a phone number, call?

561
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,676
Yeah, could you?
How are Doug and Jeanie?

562
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,343
Okay. Jeanie's got a concussion.

563
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:25,509
Hey, Jerry,
why is everyone in the hall?

564
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,743
Uh, all the beds are full
and the minors are showing up.

565
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:30,109
We got a broken jaw with
a tongue laceration coming in.

566
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,543
Yeah, well, why don't you
call up to medicine

567
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:32,743
see if they have
any spare residents.

568
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:33,776
ORS are still backed up.

569
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,409
I'm gonna start calling around

570
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:37,143
see if we can transport JJ
to another hospital.

571
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,343
It's not
a surgical case, I trust?

572
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,809
Yep, girl with
an open fracture.

573
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,809
It's been four hours.
We're running out of time.

574
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,476
‐ Where's my ruptured spleen? ‐
Trauma one.

575
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,776
Sounds like
a great teaching case.

576
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:46,776
Yeah, if they don't
get to her soon

577
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:47,776
she's gonna lose her leg.

578
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:49,643
We got at least two hours.

579
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,676
‐ Call Mercy anyway.
‐ Damn right.

580
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:55,776
You're gonna need sutures.

581
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:00,809
Sorry..

582
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:02,576
...for everything.

583
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,443
I'm gonna go to Anspaugh.

584
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,076
I'm gonna throw
myself on my sword

585
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:12,609
see if he'll open
the clinic again.

586
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:15,443
Anspaugh's gonna
keep the clinic open.

587
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:19,643
He changed his mind?

588
00:22:19,676 --> 00:22:22,309
I threw myself on my sword.

589
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,709
Lynette Evans is gonna
take over the clinic.

590
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,609
I'm back to my blue‐collar roots

591
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:30,476
punching the clock in the ER.

592
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:36,409
I don't know what to say.

593
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:37,709
There isn't anything to say.

594
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:40,276
It's done.

595
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:42,309
Just have to accept it
and move on.

596
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:46,376
I'm gonna resign..

597
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:51,409
...take responsibility for
everything that happened.

598
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:57,043
I'm destroying
my relationship with you.

599
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:03,443
I've probably
lost my best friend.

600
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:06,676
I've certainly damaged
both of your careers.

601
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:12,576
I hate Weaver.
I hate Romano.

602
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:16,643
It's time to go.

603
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,643
Where?

604
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,443
I liked Seattle
when I was in med school.

605
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,076
I didn't see much of it
but I liked it.

606
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:26,243
‐ Seattle?
‐ The Pacific Northwest.

607
00:23:27,443 --> 00:23:30,343
Take that job offer in Portland.

608
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:32,643
It's pretty up there.
It's clear.

609
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,309
You'd like it.

610
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,476
Come with me.

611
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:46,843
Carol, we got
another rig coming in.

612
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:49,043
I'll be right there.

613
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:55,243
I love you.

614
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:07,743
I grew up here.

615
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,543
My family's here,
my friends, my job.

616
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:15,309
You just got demoted.

617
00:24:15,343 --> 00:24:17,343
Yeah, well, you had something
to do with that, didn't you?

618
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:25,476
Hey..

619
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:32,476
...come with me.

620
00:24:42,776 --> 00:24:45,409
I got to get back to work.
We'll talk about it later, okay?

621
00:24:55,403 --> 00:24:56,370
Vitals stable.

622
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,370
Minor lacs to the abdomen

623
00:24:57,403 --> 00:24:58,370
dislocate her right index finger

624
00:24:58,403 --> 00:24:59,870
and ear laceration.

625
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,437
My hoop earring
got stuck on my coat.

626
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,537
How many more
you have coming in?

627
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,037
Elise is the last.

628
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,203
Mark, Maggie needs you in two.

629
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,203
Alright, find a spot for her.

630
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:11,303
Oh, man. Uh, Mrs. Ikabo..

631
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:13,203
‐ Carol, do you have a second?
‐ Not really. No.

632
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:14,837
Can you talk to Mrs. Ikabo?

633
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,970
This is Mobalage's wife,
the custodian.

634
00:25:17,003 --> 00:25:18,537
He's gonna have surgery tomorrow

635
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,503
for erectile dysfunction.
She's a little anxious.

636
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:22,137
Okay. Sure.

637
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:24,070
Mrs. Ikabo, I...I'm sorry.

638
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,437
Nurse Hathaway's gonna
be able to answer

639
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,070
any of your questions, okay?

640
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,437
I'll be right with you.

641
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,303
Jeanie's head CT is normal,
no sign of a bleed.

642
00:25:33,337 --> 00:25:35,003
Her abdominal CT shows

643
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:36,437
a small amount of
fluid around the liver.

644
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,537
‐ Yeah. That could be blood.
‐ No, no, no.

645
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,537
‐ Liver's intact, no laceration.
‐ There's pain on palpation?

646
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,003
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Those her labs?

647
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:46,037
Yeah. CBC's normal.

648
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,503
LFT is elevated,
especially ALT

649
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:49,970
PT is high.

650
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,437
From a trauma?

651
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,370
Bilirubin's abnormal,
albumin is low.

652
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,103
So..

653
00:25:58,303 --> 00:25:59,270
...what do you think?

654
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:00,870
I think these results

655
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:03,337
don't have anything to do with
the accident.

656
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,003
Yeah. Neither do I.

657
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:07,070
So what do you wanna do?

658
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:08,470
Draw up a hepatitis panel

659
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:10,237
and, uh, give her some vitamin K

660
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,437
admit her to medicine
for a liver biopsy.

661
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:25,203
Oh, Mrs. Ikabo.

662
00:26:25,237 --> 00:26:28,403
I'm sorry
for making you wait.

663
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:30,803
Do you want a soda?

664
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:34,537
Um, Dr. Greene said that
you might have some questions

665
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,770
about your husband's surgery.

666
00:26:37,803 --> 00:26:40,237
Do you know
what happened to Mobalage?

667
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,837
He was tortured
in Nigeria, right?

668
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,770
Um..

669
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:48,503
...Dr. Greene said
that after tomorrow..

670
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:51,203
...he will be able to..

671
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,470
...have relations again?

672
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,803
Yes, if it's successful.

673
00:26:56,837 --> 00:26:59,037
I don't know if I can.

674
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,370
Can you tell me why not?

675
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:11,070
Mobalage was a student leader.

676
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:13,537
A dissident.

677
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,037
After they
tortured him, he fled.

678
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,770
When‐when I joined him here,
he was happy we were together

679
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:24,103
but not interested
in me in that way.

680
00:27:26,037 --> 00:27:28,270
Well, um..

681
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:31,003
...you have to, you have
to help him through this.

682
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,870
I should go.
I'm sorry to bother you.

683
00:27:35,903 --> 00:27:38,837
Wait, Mrs. Ikabo.

684
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,303
What is it?

685
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:46,237
‐ I can't.
‐ You can't...what?

686
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:53,270
After he left..

687
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,337
...they came for me.

688
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,237
Ten soldiers..

689
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:04,903
...each took their turn.

690
00:28:04,937 --> 00:28:08,303
All night and
into the next day.

691
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:11,803
In our home.

692
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:22,337
I never told him.

693
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,003
I‐I want him
to be happy, but..

694
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:30,337
I don't know if I can
be with a man again.

695
00:28:32,403 --> 00:28:34,037
You have to tell him.

696
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,503
It would kill him.

697
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:42,170
‐ But he loves you.
‐ No.

698
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:55,737
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

699
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,037
I didn't mean to
wake you up. Sorry.

700
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,437
What time is it?

701
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,303
It's, uh..

702
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:08,070
...2:30.

703
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,403
Sutures look great.
Who did them?

704
00:29:10,437 --> 00:29:12,437
Peter.

705
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,437
Took forever.

706
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,370
He's kind of a perfectionist,
if you hadn't noticed.

707
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,403
I got a bed for you upstairs

708
00:29:20,437 --> 00:29:23,037
so you can get some real sleep.

709
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:26,070
How are you feeling?

710
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,837
Sore.

711
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,770
So what is it?

712
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:34,437
Peter took some more blood.

713
00:29:36,337 --> 00:29:37,937
Um..

714
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:40,903
...how‐how have you
been feeling lately?

715
00:29:44,803 --> 00:29:46,103
A little run‐down.

716
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:48,270
‐ Is it AIDS?
‐ No.

717
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:52,770
Your T‐cell count was normal

718
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:56,437
but your liver
function tests indicate

719
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,770
that you might have hepatitis

720
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:01,037
'and your abdominal CT'

721
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:04,803
'showed a small amount of fluid
around your liver capsule.'

722
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:09,837
'Uh, have you been tested?'

723
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:12,970
Yeah, I had, um..

724
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:18,937
...hepatitis "B" vaccination
five or six years ago.

725
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,070
I hadn't had an "A."

726
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:26,137
‐ So you think it's "C"?
‐ It might be.

727
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,803
We need to admit you

728
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:30,070
and do a few tests.

729
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:33,870
That sounds like
the doctor answer.

730
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:35,503
I was..

731
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:38,003
...kinda hoping for
a good friend answer.

732
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,403
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

733
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:44,070
'That'd be my guess.'

734
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:52,770
All this time,
I'm worrying about HIV

735
00:30:52,803 --> 00:30:55,803
and I get hepatitis "C."

736
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,903
Huh?

737
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:00,970
We should do the biopsy.

738
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:03,403
Oh, I mi‐might,
I might be wrong.

739
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:05,503
Wouldn't be the first time.

740
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:08,037
Maybe the second time.

741
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,803
Maybe the third time.

742
00:31:16,237 --> 00:31:19,437
Wow, I just thought she was
anxious about the surgery.

743
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,903
She is.

744
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:22,237
It's scheduled
for this morning.

745
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,503
I know. We need to
get them some therapy.

746
00:31:24,537 --> 00:31:26,403
I'll call Riley,
see if he knows anybody

747
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:30,270
who specializes in PTSD
in torture victims.

748
00:31:32,037 --> 00:31:34,137
Doug says he's gonna quit.

749
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,003
Yeah?

750
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:40,770
I think he's serious.

751
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,437
Maybe he should.

752
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:49,803
You want him to go?

753
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:52,970
I'm done, Carol.

754
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:56,803
I love him like a brother

755
00:31:56,837 --> 00:31:58,037
but I can't do this anymore.

756
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,837
It's too hard.

757
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:04,370
He says he wants to move
to Seattle or Portland.

758
00:32:04,403 --> 00:32:06,237
He wants me to go with him.

759
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,903
Are you going to?

760
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:16,403
I can't remem‐remember
a time when I didn't love him.

761
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,503
I'll miss you..

762
00:32:30,437 --> 00:32:32,137
...maybe more than
I'll miss him.

763
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:49,037
I gotta go.

764
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,037
Mrs. Martino?

765
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,503
Anthony's stable.

766
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:16,003
So is he okay?

767
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,370
Well, he's gonna
need exploratory surgery

768
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:20,270
but I think
he's gonna be fine.

769
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:22,070
‐ Can I see him?
‐ Yes, please.

770
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,403
Follow me.

771
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:36,803
Thank you.

772
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,470
‐ She seems happy.
‐ Very.

773
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,437
It's gonna be light soon.

774
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:47,970
When did you sleep last?

775
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,103
Day before yesterday.

776
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:51,870
You?

777
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:54,170
24 hours ago.

778
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:56,437
I feel like an intern again.

779
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,903
‐ Good work.
‐ Yeah, you too.

780
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:29,037
Is this where you work?

781
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,103
Most of the time, yeah.

782
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:41,837
I'm surprised to see
you're still here

783
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,137
this late at night.

784
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,037
I thought doctors made
life‐and‐death decisions

785
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,337
about other people's families

786
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,170
and then go home

787
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:50,370
to their million‐dollar homes

788
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:52,770
and stoli martinis.

789
00:34:59,537 --> 00:35:00,937
He was in agony.

790
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,970
He was dying
not in days, in hours.

791
00:35:04,003 --> 00:35:06,437
You stole my son from me.

792
00:35:08,203 --> 00:35:11,137
'Joi called and I caught
the first flight out.'

793
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,337
I came as quickly as I could.

794
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,403
'Ricky died and I wasn't there.'

795
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:19,103
'I didn't get to hold his hand.'

796
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:22,037
'I didn't get to say goodbye.'

797
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,770
'You stole that from me.'

798
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,270
Mm.

799
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:35,970
‐ Mm.
‐ That's disgusting.

800
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,937
Really? It's not bad.

801
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,937
I was thinking about
getting another one.

802
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,503
You got anymore quarters?

803
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,103
Stab wound to the chest,
large kitchen knife.

804
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:46,503
BP 70 palp.
Ran two liters saline in.

805
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:47,937
Couldn't get
the pressure back up.

806
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,370
Pulse ox is 91 on ten liters.

807
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:51,837
‐ Mark, it's Mrs. Ikabo.
‐ What?

808
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,903
‐ Wh‐what happened?
‐ Her husband freaked out.

809
00:35:53,937 --> 00:35:55,237
Called 911,
but wouldn't let us in.

810
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,270
She was bleeding
all over the place.

811
00:35:57,303 --> 00:35:58,370
Hang two units of O‐neg.

812
00:35:58,403 --> 00:35:59,970
Order four type‐specific

813
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:01,770
'and cross match another four.'

814
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,370
Pulse is weak
and thready at 140.

815
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:06,203
Okay, everybody, we're gonna do
this on my count, nice and easy.

816
00:36:06,237 --> 00:36:09,803
Ready? One, two, three.

817
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,937
‐ 'Let's get an EKG.'
‐ 'Poor cap refill.'

818
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,770
Mark, she's cold.

819
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,537
No breath sounds on the right.
Tracheal shift to the left.

820
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,270
She's got dilated neck veins.

821
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:18,903
Tension pneumo, 14 gauge.

822
00:36:18,937 --> 00:36:20,370
I'll decompress.
Where's her husband?

823
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:22,003
‐ He jumped out the window.
‐ What?

824
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:23,903
Cops had to ram down
the door for us to get in.

825
00:36:23,937 --> 00:36:26,470
He took off on foot. They were
still chasing him when we left.

826
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,770
Where the hell's
the trauma team?

827
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,970
We're not very compatible.

828
00:36:31,003 --> 00:36:34,270
I think the best thing for us
to do is to go back to being‐‐

829
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:36,070
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi. Hey.

830
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:38,370
‐ What are you doing up here?
‐ Uh, waiting for you.

831
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:41,237
‐ Really?
‐ Um, yeah.

832
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,237
Look, is there someplace
that we can, uh, we can go?

833
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,937
Um, we could go back to my dorm.

834
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,837
‐ My roommate leaves by 6:30.
‐ Your dorm?

835
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,870
‐ Okay, fine, your place, then.
‐ Weaver's house?

836
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:52,170
No, no, see,
this is the problem.

837
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,970
You're a student
and I'm a resident.

838
00:36:55,003 --> 00:36:57,237
‐ Right, so you said.
‐ And we're not very compatible.

839
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,937
Yeah, that's true.

840
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,403
Very few people drive me
crazy the way that you do.

841
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:04,337
Yeah, but you irritate
the hell out of me.

842
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,937
Right.
Right.

843
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,503
So clearly, this is not
something that's gonna work.

844
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:10,903
And I mean between
hospital policy

845
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,403
and us not really
liking each other

846
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:14,803
we should just accept the fact
that yesterday was a mistake

847
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:16,803
and we should, uh,
things should go back

848
00:37:16,837 --> 00:37:17,803
to being the way
they were before.

849
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:18,870
Oh.

850
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,870
I think that's
the smartest thing

851
00:37:19,903 --> 00:37:21,070
to do for everyone involved.

852
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:23,003
Oh.

853
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:24,503
‐ We could just have sex.
‐ No, no, that's my point.

854
00:37:24,537 --> 00:37:26,437
‐ We can't just have sex.
‐ I don't wanna have s..

855
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,770
Hi. How are you?
It was a mistake.

856
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,070
‐ It was wrong.
‐ Got you.

857
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,837
Carter, you're really
gullible, you know that?

858
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,803
‐ Ha, ha, ha. That wasn't funny.
‐ Sure, it is.

859
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,370
Look, you don't wanna hang out
that's fine with me.

860
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:36,870
I'm not really
attracted to you anyway.

861
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:38,237
‐ Oh, you're not?
‐ No.

862
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,003
You're a little
closed off for my tastes.

863
00:37:40,037 --> 00:37:42,203
‐ Closed off?
‐ Emotionally withdrawn.

864
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:43,337
Not really in touch
with your feelings.

865
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,503
‐ I am not.
‐ Sure, you are.

866
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:46,003
‐ I am not!
‐ Just forget it, okay?

867
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:47,537
You're right.
We're not compatible.

868
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,103
Believe me, I'm in touch
with my feelings right now.

869
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:50,937
‐ And I wanna throttle you.
‐ "Throttle?"

870
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,237
There's an in‐touch‐
with‐your‐feelings kinda word.

871
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,937
Oh, now you're gonna
ridicule my vocabulary.

872
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,403
I just, okay, I just meant
opposites attract, okay?

873
00:37:56,437 --> 00:37:57,403
We sound like my grandparents.

874
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:59,303
They've been married 56 years..

875
00:37:59,337 --> 00:38:01,170
...still having great sex too.

876
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:57,737
‐ My wife, is she dead?
‐ No.

877
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,437
‐ So where are they taking her?
‐ To surgery.

878
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,337
They're...trying to save her.

879
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,170
‐ Can they?
‐ I don't know.

880
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,437
Oh, what have I done?

881
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:15,237
'Carol, what's going on?'

882
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,970
Are you...are you alright?

883
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:21,270
Yeah, we're fine.
We need Mark, though.

884
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:22,803
Can you...can you get Mark?

885
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:25,470
Yes, Dr. Greene, please.

886
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:28,870
‐ Sure, I can do that.
‐ And security PTSD.

887
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:36,037
You've got a big
cut on your leg.

888
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,937
I ran away.

889
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,803
Oh...God.

890
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:21,236
Thought I'd find you up here.

891
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,703
How's she doing?

892
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:25,703
She's fine. Sedated.

893
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,636
So I spoke to Anspaugh.

894
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:49,603
I told him I was quitting.

895
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:51,436
And what'd he say?

896
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:53,536
Well, he was polite enough
not to burst into song.

897
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:56,703
Didn't try and
talk me out of it.

898
00:40:56,736 --> 00:40:59,736
‐ Well, did you expect him to?
‐ No.

899
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:05,469
Uh, Julian in genetics

900
00:41:05,503 --> 00:41:07,503
stood up for me with the cops.

901
00:41:07,536 --> 00:41:10,736
‐ And?
‐ They're not gonna prosecute.

902
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:14,436
‐ That's great.
‐ Yeah.

903
00:41:21,236 --> 00:41:23,269
Long night, huh?

904
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:26,769
Yep.

905
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:30,503
You're not coming
with me, are you?

906
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:35,103
Are you really leaving?

907
00:41:38,669 --> 00:41:40,736
There's nothing for me here.

908
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:44,736
I'm here.

909
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,703
I mean work.

910
00:41:47,736 --> 00:41:50,036
I can't stay here.

911
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:52,769
‐ Not even for me?
‐ Come with me.

912
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:56,403
I want you to stay here.

913
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:00,169
I can't.

914
00:42:02,736 --> 00:42:05,569
I don't understand that.

915
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,436
I have to go, Carol.

916
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:15,236
I can't stay here.

917
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:29,069
Doug..

918
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:35,636
...I don't wanna
wake up alone tomorrow.

919
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,303
I love you.

920
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:38,569
'Well, this is living.'

921
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:42,269
Brown‐bagging it on
the lake in February.

922
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:43,469
If this isn't
the coldest place on earth

923
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:44,703
I don't know what is.

924
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:46,469
It was your idea
to come out here.

925
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:47,769
I'm just trying
to remind myself

926
00:43:47,803 --> 00:43:50,136
why I'm so happy getting
the hell out of here.

927
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:56,269
You're not gonna become
a trail blazers fan, are you?

928
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,436
Maybe..

929
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,703
...or the sonics.

930
00:43:59,736 --> 00:44:02,536
That's just wrong.

931
00:44:02,569 --> 00:44:03,803
Seahawks?

932
00:44:03,836 --> 00:44:06,036
I don't know. Maybe.

933
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:12,269
Doesn't it rain, like
300 days a year out there?

934
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:15,236
Save me a lot of money
watering my lawn.

935
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:17,069
You don't have a lawn.

936
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,036
‐ Want to play some hoops?
‐ Sure.

937
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:37,436
Come on.

938
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,503
You know what
I am going to miss?

939
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:39,569
What?

940
00:44:39,603 --> 00:44:41,469
Whipping your ass on the court.

941
00:44:41,503 --> 00:44:43,103
Oh, right.

942
00:44:43,136 --> 00:44:44,503
I don't think
I ever lost a game.

943
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:47,569
‐ In your dreams.
‐ Play for a buck a point?

944
00:44:47,603 --> 00:44:51,103
‐ Hell, no.
‐ What, are you scared?

945
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:53,636
No. You cheat.

946
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:55,036
‐ I do not.
‐ You do cheat.

947
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,003
‐ I do not.
‐ You're a cheater.
