1
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:07,500
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,400
Dr. Carter, hi.

3
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:11,733
Normally, I would, but as
of today, I'm only an intern.

4
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:13,133
Yeah, I heard about that.
I couldn't believe it.

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,766
Kerry, this is Dr. Dan Litvak.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,500
Just here to
get a few tips?

7
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:17,700
No, I just had my
second interview

8
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,133
for the chief position.

9
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:20,733
Peter, have you
not told everyone?

10
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,333
My son is deaf.
I know that, okay?

11
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,166
Aren't you supposed
to be setting policy?

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm here
for the ride‐along.

13
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:27,800
If he vomits and gets
that into his lungs

14
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,533
he could die
of aspiration pneumonia.

15
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,033
What happened was,
two of your classmates

16
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,766
almost died tonight.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,533
It was stupid of me to think
that you were mature enough

18
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:35,700
to take responsibility.

19
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:46,600
Doug, what are you doing?
It's 5:00 o'clock.

20
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:49,100
I'm a week behind
on my Q&A reports.

21
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,700
And that is
the good news.

22
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:53,533
How long have you been up?

23
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:55,333
I haven't been
to sleep.

24
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:58,633
Oh, God!
Anything I can do?

25
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,333
No. Go back to bed.

26
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,033
There's no use both of us
being miserable.

27
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,466
No. It's lonely
there without you.

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,433
You keep that up,
I'm never gonna finish.

29
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,000
Mmm. Sorry.

30
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:16,666
Now I know how you felt
when you opened your clinic.

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,300
It's pretty scary, huh?

32
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,466
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,033
Are we both nuts?

34
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,233
Yeah.

35
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,500
‐ But it's worth it.
‐ Mmm.

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,100
Oh, Dr. Carter.

37
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,800
I didn't think
you'd be up yet.

38
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,266
‐ I left you a note.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

39
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,366
Um, I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
that you lost your RA job
because of the Halloween dance.

41
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,700
Yeah. Me, too.

42
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,266
And, um, I was
wondering if you thought

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,200
it might help if I wrote
the dean a letter.

44
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:52,233
Thanks, but I think
you've done enough already.

45
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:55,033
Or at least, I could help you
pack. I'm not on until 7:00.

46
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,566
No, I can manage.
Now, if you don't mind..

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,200
‐ Where are you gonna live?
‐ Ow! That's my leg.

48
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,033
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh, I
didn't realize you had company.

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,633
I'll see you at the hospital.

50
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,733
I'm very glad you're moving.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,400
So your beef is
with nurses asking

52
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,400
inappropriate questions
over the radio.

53
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:25,800
Yeah, I'll say.

54
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,300
Patients freak out
when someone asks

55
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,566
if they got track marks.

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,066
Alright.
I'll talk to the nurses.

57
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,500
Uh, you know, they asked
me to remind you

58
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,533
not to restock your rig
with their supplies.

59
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:38,766
Oh, man.
That is so lame.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,433
Nothing is gonna change
unless we all throw

61
00:02:41,466 --> 00:02:42,766
our gripes
out on the table.

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,233
You guys want to
get some breakfast

63
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,100
before we head back
to the station?

64
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,800
Yeah. Definitely. I'm hungry.
I could use an omelet and uh..

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,266
‐ What the hell was that?
‐ Gunfire.

66
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,666
It came from behind us.

67
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,033
'Looks like bangers.'

68
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,166
Hey, someone's down!

69
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,700
'Unit 62. We have a possible GSW
on the 1600 block of Halsted.'

70
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,200
Gunfire in the vicinity.

71
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,466
Why aren't you backing up?

72
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,066
We have to wait for
the area to be secured.

73
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,300
I don't hear any gunfire.

74
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,500
It doesn't mean
it won't start again

75
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,766
once you're out there.

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,633
Well, I'm not
gonna wait in here.

77
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,466
Protocol says,
we wait for backup.

78
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,566
'Wait!'

79
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,466
Damn it!

80
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,566
What the hell are you doing?

81
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:40,400
Did you hear that?
We should not be out here.

82
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,400
It doesn't mean that
they're coming back.

83
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:45,300
‐ Give me a hand.
‐ Is he shot?

84
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,700
There's no entrance wound.
He's just beat up.

85
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:49,666
‐ Ready to roll him?
‐ Alright, Go.

86
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,333
He's not breathing.
We have to intubate.

87
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,666
‐ Not here. In the rig.
‐ Now.

88
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,033
Ah, there's
too much blood. Suction.

89
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,633
Morales, Gurney!

90
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,133
I can't see the cords.

91
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,600
You want me to crank
his head back?

92
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,733
We haven't cleared his C‐spine.

93
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,466
He's still not breathing.

94
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,066
Extend his neck.

95
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,566
You ER guys are nuts.

96
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes. I'm in.

97
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,666
Okay.

98
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,733
Let's move him and bag him.

99
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,466
One, two, three.

100
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,066
I'm losing his pulse.

101
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,466
Yeah. We'll have to
start two large‐bore IVS.

102
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,300
You wanna do that here, too?

103
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:52,133
No. We'll do it
while we're rolling.

104
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,233
Next time you decide
to do a ride‐along

105
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,633
I'm taking a day off.

106
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,633
Lights and sirens. Let's go.

107
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Good morning, everyone.
What do we got?

108
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:57,066
16‐year‐old male, found
beaten in the streets.

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,066
Sustained a concussion
and multiple contusions to‐‐

110
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,300
Head, neck and extremities.

111
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,666
BP's 140/80,
pulse 110 and regular.

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,766
Good air entry bilaterally.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,166
Any ID?

114
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,333
No. Just a couple of bucks.

115
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:14,366
Okay, everybody, on my count.
One, two, three.

116
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,233
Cowboy Greene to the rescue.

117
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,200
‐ Babinski's normal.
‐ BP 120/78.

118
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,433
Regular rate and rhythm.

119
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,366
'Spontaneous eye opening.'

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Okay. Can you wiggle your toes?

121
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,666
‐ Yup. Follows commands.
‐ How's he doing?

122
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,300
Stable.
No apparent neuro deficits.

123
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,233
That was some
crazy stunt.

124
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,533
You lucked out
this time.

125
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,566
What was that all about?

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,133
Uh, paramedics got
a little perturbed

127
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,433
because I tubed him
in the field.

128
00:06:42,466 --> 00:06:44,033
Radiology's here.

129
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:47,533
So, word is Dan Litvak
turned down ER Chief.

130
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:49,200
What happened?

131
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,266
I heard he played your
committee for patsies.

132
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,500
Used the offer to negotiate
a bigger salary back home.

133
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:56,266
I probably shouldn't
be telling you this

134
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,566
but you're the only other
candidate on the short list.

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,166
Really?

136
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,800
Okay. "Cat‐lover seeks
like‐minded roommate?"

137
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,300
Forget it.

138
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,533
Would you consider joining

139
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:08,333
a communal vegetarian household?

140
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:09,800
Alright. Here's one.

141
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,600
Uh, "Furnished apartment
in old town home..

142
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,766
...access to full kitchen,
many amenities.."

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,400
‐ Oh, that sounds promising.
‐ Yeah.

144
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:17,800
And not too far
from the hospital.

145
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,466
Look. I can talk
to my realtor and set up

146
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,666
an appointment
for you after work.

147
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,733
‐ Right. See you later.
‐ Bye.

148
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,700
Take a deep breath.
Alright, blow hard.

149
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,166
Hard.

150
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,233
Okay.

151
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,466
‐ You alright?
‐ Yeah.

152
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,433
Pulse ox
is holding at 98.

153
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,633
I'm Dr. Greene.

154
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,266
Do you know
what happened to you?

155
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,666
I was with a John.

156
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,766
Bangers tried to rob us.
My John pulled a gun.

157
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,766
‐ That's where I go blank.
‐ Uh‐huh.

158
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,600
We found you on the street.

159
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,266
Brought you here by ambulance.

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,600
What were you doing
cruising in my neighborhood?

161
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,433
Sometimes I ride‐along
with paramedics.

162
00:07:54,466 --> 00:07:55,600
Uh‐huh.

163
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,400
You know, you're the first guy
who's ever saved my life.

164
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:03,066
Yeah. Well, I don't go out
in the street for just anybody.

165
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,200
Hmm. I guess I got to
grant you a wish now, huh?

166
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,066
What?

167
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,800
You know, like in
"I Dream Of Jeannie"

168
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,733
when Major Nelson
rescued her from a bottle.

169
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,366
Why don't we just start
with your name and age.

170
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,300
Kevin Dulaney. I'm 16 years old.

171
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,533
Lily, why don't you
find Kevin's labs

172
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,766
and see if you can
get us an open exam room.

173
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,566
Sure.

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,766
Where do you live, Kevin?

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,433
Pretty much where you found me.

176
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,733
Any family?

177
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,700
None who want to know me.

178
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:36,100
Why is that?

179
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,466
A year ago, my old man caught me

180
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,733
having sex with
my gymnastics coach.

181
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,733
And he kicked me
out of the house.

182
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,600
Any other sad details
you want to hear?

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,633
So...you survive
by hustling.

184
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,400
Yeah. Well, someone's got
to pay the bills, right?

185
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:57,600
Use condoms?

186
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,466
Sometimes.

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,533
Customers pay more
to ride me bareback.

188
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,633
We have a new
rapid HIV test.

189
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,700
You can get results
in 20 minutes.

190
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:09,466
How about it?

191
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,033
You wanna bet I'm positive?

192
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,466
Well, if you are,
we can treat you.

193
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Sure.

194
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,566
Hey, it looks like
a good turnout

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,133
for the BP
screening, huh?

196
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,266
I, uh, posted signs
at the Senior Center.

197
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,266
If it ever stops raining,
we'll be jammed.

198
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,100
‐ Ow! Not so tight.
‐ Okay, I'm sorry, Mr. Levy.

199
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:31,366
But in order to get an accurate
reading, it has to be snug.

200
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
I tell you,
it's too damn tight.

201
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,666
Okay. Take it easy.
I'll loosen it up a bit.

202
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,433
My arm's gonna blow off.

203
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,166
Hey, you know what
we should do next time?

204
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,300
Maybe, extend the outreach.
Go into the community.

205
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,333
Take BPs, check for glaucoma.
What do you think?

206
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:45,700
That's not a bad idea.
Okay. Your pressure's fine.

207
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,200
No thanks to you.

208
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,766
'Carol, did you page me?'

209
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,033
Oh, yeah.
I will be right back.

210
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:54,300
‐ What's up?
‐ This'll just take a minute.

211
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,166
‐ We're swamped here.
‐ I know, I know.

212
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,266
‐ Hah.
‐ A lab coat?

213
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,033
Yes.

214
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,800
It's what every well‐dressed
division head should wear.

215
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,766
Well, I guess there's
no backing out now.

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,166
What do you think?

217
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,466
Come here.

218
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,766
I thought you said,
you were busy.

219
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,633
‐ Not that busy.
‐ No?

220
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,566
‐ Carter, you paged me?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,433
68‐year‐old male
with a history

222
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,700
of previous
abdominal surgery.

223
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,333
I'm thinking,
small‐bowel obstruction.

224
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:27,666
‐ Hmm...you do a three‐way?
‐ Right here.

225
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,633
Air fluid levels and he's
got a stepladder pattern.

226
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,200
Hmm. Good call.

227
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,733
‐ I must've driven you crazy.
‐ What're you talkin' about?

228
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:39,666
My student.
She's driving me nuts.

229
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,566
Makes stupid mistakes,
asks too many questions..

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,633
...shows poor judgment.

231
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,100
How'd you ever
put up with me?

232
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,200
I never gave you
any thought, Carter.

233
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,800
‐ You didn't?
‐ Carter.

234
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,466
Medical students
don't know anything.

235
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,766
It's your job to teach them.
Not be their friend.

236
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,166
Exhale, Mrs. Delpit, like you're
blowing out birthday candles.

237
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,433
Ah‐ah‐ah, ah‐ah. Before
listening with a stethoscope

238
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:09,733
test for tactile fremitus.

239
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,300
By placing your hand
on the patient's back

240
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,300
and asking her to repeat
the word "ninety‐nine".

241
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,733
I haven't tested
for tactile fremitus

242
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:20,433
since I was a first year.

243
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,633
I have to be sure that
you can do a complete exam.

244
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,266
Alright.

245
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,633
Mrs. Delpit, will you please

246
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,466
repeat "ninety‐nine" for me?

247
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,266
Ninety‐nine, ninety‐nine

248
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,566
ninety‐nine, ninety‐nine,
ninety‐nine..

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,700
Blood alcohol level came back.

250
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,100
Did it set a record?

251
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,600
No, but it's up there.

252
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,100
0.16.

253
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,033
Bah! That's nothing.

254
00:11:49,066 --> 00:11:51,766
Last time I got picked up,
I scored a 26.

255
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,100
I also have your HIV results.

256
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,366
It's AIDS, right?

257
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,366
No. It's good news.
You're negative.

258
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,733
So I guess, my Johns
don't need rubbers after all.

259
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,466
I'm gonna charge them
a fortune.

260
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,066
You're not gonna stay
negative long

261
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,333
if you don't protect yourself.

262
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,500
Maybe, it's time, you started
getting your life together.

263
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,333
Yeah. I do kind of stink.

264
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,066
Hey, do you think
I could get a shower?

265
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,766
'Maybe, some clean clothes?'

266
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,766
I'll have the nurses come
and take you to the shower room.

267
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,133
Care to join me?

268
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:30,600
No, thanks.
I had one this morning.

269
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:33,366
Peter, hold on.
Have you got a moment?

270
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,300
Uh, no. We got
a small‐bowel obstruction.

271
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,200
I know. I'm operating with you.

272
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:41,233
‐ Meet your new intern.
‐ Since when?

273
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,700
This morning, if you'll have me.

274
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,400
‐ Go ahead. Bring him in.
‐ Okay.

275
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,566
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Was this Anspaugh's idea?

276
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,666
Actually, it was mine.
But Anspaugh supports it.

277
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,033
‐ Enthusiastically, I might add.
‐ Mmm..

278
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:52,600
‐ 'Dr. Benton?'
‐ I don't know, Elizabeth.

279
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,566
Oh, come on, Peter.
Don't be such a wet blanket.

280
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,533
Just think. No more
of Dale's scut and you have

281
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,166
the chance of working
with an alluring intern.

282
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,666
I don't think I feel
comfortable with that.

283
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,733
Why not? We've always
made a great team.

284
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,333
Yeah, but that's when
we were both residents.

285
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,200
Now, I'd have
to be your boss.

286
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:09,500
Yeah. Well, uh,
I don't mind if you don't.

287
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,633
Look. Then I'll be
accused of playing favorites

288
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
if I don't treat
you like an intern.

289
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,800
I'm not asking for
special treatment.

290
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,400
Just the chance to do
something more than pull drains.

291
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,666
Elizabeth, I don't think
it'll be, you know..

292
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,400
...I don't think it'll be
good for us. I..

293
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,733
Alright.
I'll think about it, okay?

294
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,633
You know what?
You don't have to.

295
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,700
I already heard your answer.

296
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,066
Orange juice?
You want orange juice, Reese?

297
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,466
Huh? Is that what you want?

298
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,133
‐ Coffee, please.
‐ You want to take a sip?

299
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,333
Hey, you guys
taking a lunch break?

300
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,666
Hey. Yeah.

301
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,333
Figured we'd come out here

302
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,733
and get some fresh air
since it stopped raining.

303
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,266
Yeah, me too.

304
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Oh, he's getting so big.
You're going to be tall

305
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,066
like your daddy,
aren't you, huh?

306
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,533
Yeah.

307
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:00,500
Peter, I wasn't aware that
Reese had a hearing problem.

308
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah, we just
found out recently.

309
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,733
He's deaf.
Come on, man. Come on.

310
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:09,266
What approach are you using
for language acquisition

311
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,066
if you don't mind
my asking.

312
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,266
Well, we're working
with an audiologist.

313
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,600
Teaching him
to vocalize.

314
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:16,133
Have you looked into
speech‐reading and signings?

315
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,566
He still has
residual hearing.

316
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,233
Actually, I'm looking
for an aggressive ENT

317
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,400
who'll consider him a candidate
for cochlear implant.

318
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,666
Well, they would have to
destroy his residual hearing.

319
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,266
Yeah, but the technology
is very advanced.

320
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,600
You should talk
to Lisa Parks at UFC.

321
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,466
She's an outstanding physician

322
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,300
and has expertise
in this field.

323
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,533
‐ She's a friend of yours?
‐ I'll give you her number.

324
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:38,133
‐ She's on the cutting edge.
‐ Okay.

325
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,300
Thanks.

326
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,266
ER.
Yep. Hold on.

327
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,466
Dr. Ross.

328
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,733
I'm a bit busy here, Jer.

329
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,133
Well, they said
it was urgent.

330
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,300
Huh. Alright.

331
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,466
This is Dr. Ross.

332
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
Me too, kiddo.

333
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,400
Where are you?

334
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,066
I was just thinking about you.

335
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,166
Nurse, I have to have
my sugar checked.

336
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,333
Gotta go.
What's the problem?

337
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,033
That other nurse said,
I have to come back tomorrow.

338
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,566
I have sugar diabetes.

339
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,066
I schlepped all the way over
here on a bus, in the rain

340
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,100
and she tells me, I need to make
an appointment. Now what's that?

341
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,233
‐ Okay, hang on.
‐ Huh?

342
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,500
Lynette, did you tell Mr. Levy,
he needed an appointment

343
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,800
to have his blood
glucose checked?

344
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,333
Did he give you
that song and dance

345
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:26,600
about taking the bus
in the rain?

346
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,233
Yeah.

347
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:30,266
Well, he's got a bunch
of other complaints.

348
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,433
Ladies, I hate to interrupt
but I haven't had

349
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,466
a bite to eat all day.

350
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,433
I have sugar diabetes.

351
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:38,200
‐ Hello!
‐ Okay.

352
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,366
Okay, Mr. Levy. I'm gonna
test your blood glucose

353
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,100
just this once
without an appointment

354
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:44,033
and then we'll order you
something to eat.

355
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,300
‐ You're an angel.
‐ Okay.

356
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,066
‐ Hope you got all afternoon.
‐ Hmm.

357
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,366
How did the accident
happen, Kate?

358
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,266
I, I lost it on wet gravel
coming down through a turn.

359
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
On the triage note,
your dad said

360
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:57,233
that you hit a curb
and then fell.

361
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,266
She fell onto the curb
after she slipped...on gravel.

362
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,700
Okay. Have a seat.

363
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,066
You might have a fracture.

364
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,233
I'll call ortho
after we get an X‐ray.

365
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,566
We'll be right back.

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,166
Call medical records. Have them
send up any old charts.

367
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,766
Good idea.

368
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,066
Uh, you feel any pain
when I press here?

369
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,466
Ow. Yeah.
A lot.

370
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,500
When did you first
feel the pain?

371
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,133
Um, when I was in the shower.

372
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,766
You had quite a blow
to your leg.

373
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,200
Could be a blood clot.

374
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,666
That's no big deal.
I've had 'em before.

375
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,666
‐ You have?
‐ Yeah.

376
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,766
Yeah, sure. I got
a protein S deficiency.

377
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
My blood clots
all the time.

378
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,400
Should've seen the mother
I had on here, about a year ago.

379
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:39,166
You know, I wish you would have
told me your history before.

380
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,733
I can't take care of you
if you're not straight with me.

381
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,633
I can't be straight.

382
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,700
Guess you want
to order a coag panel

383
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:50,400
and clotting studies and start
me on a heparin drip, right?

384
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,233
When was the last time
you were hospitalized?

385
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,633
Right before
I took off from home.

386
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,033
Alright. I'm gonna start
you on the heparin.

387
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:04,300
Then we're gonna move
to the Coumadin..

388
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,166
...just before you are
ready to be discharged.

389
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,666
No way.
I'm‐I'm not taking Coumadin.

390
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,133
Why not?

391
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,766
You have a disease
that requires you

392
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
to take a blood thinner
for the rest of your life.

393
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,433
Coumadin and the streets don't
mix. You ought to know that.

394
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,533
And you don't want me
coming back in here

395
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:22,366
bleeding my brains out because
I got drunk and hit my head.

396
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,266
You'd rather die
of a blood clot?

397
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,433
I don't sweat it.
Why should you?

398
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,233
How much insulin did
you take, Mr. Levy?

399
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,566
Oh, I'm not sure.

400
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,333
The lady who used to come over,
always gave it to me.

401
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:37,466
She also used
to trim my toenails.

402
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,066
I think one of them is infected.
Do you.. Ow!

403
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,200
‐ Got this pain in my left side.
‐ Oh, Mr. Levy's still here.

404
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,666
Have you noticed this pro‐‐

405
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,400
Apparently, he took too much
insulin this morning.

406
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:47,433
His blood sugar's 61.

407
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,333
I told you I needed
to have my blood checked.

408
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:53,466
Look, um, you were right.
I'm really stuck.

409
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,633
His home health‐aide
took a new job.

410
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,100
‐ Any family?
‐ No.

411
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:59,766
His wife died last year.
No one else in town.

412
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,166
We could try to get him a
temporary nursing home placement

413
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,700
till we can set him
up with a new aide.

414
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,466
I'm not going
to a nursing home. Ow!

415
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,166
Just temporarily,
Mr. Levy.

416
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,100
The guy at the desk said,
Mr. Levy was in here.

417
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,100
‐ You got my kung pao chicken?
‐ Yes, sir.

418
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,300
‐ Uh, egg rolls?
‐ Yes, sir. All right here.

419
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,333
‐ That'll be $8.50.
‐ Very reasonable.

420
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,666
‐ You ordered Chinese?
‐ She said, I needed to eat.

421
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,366
I'll get my wallet.

422
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,533
Why don't you make
it an even $10?

423
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,133
Where's my fortune cookie?

424
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,200
I was just wondering.
Am I gonna get to work

425
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,266
with any other residents
here in the ER?

426
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,766
Why? Is there a problem?

427
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,433
No, I just thought
I might learn more

428
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,233
by working with a
variety of teachers.

429
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,666
Well, that's up
to the attendings.

430
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,633
Why don't you tell me
about this patient?

431
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,133
Um, Brad Enloe, 12.

432
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,366
History of
recurrent Leukemia.

433
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,700
Relapse after second
induction of chemo

434
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,200
and he's here today for a fever
and a sore throat.

435
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,366
That poor kid's
been through a lot.

436
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,366
Well, it's our job
to treat the patient.

437
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,533
Not feel sorry for him.

438
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,733
Hi, Brad.
I'm Dr. Carter.

439
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,466
This is my medical student,
Lucy Knight.

440
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,066
I hear, your, uh, throat hurts.

441
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,800
Yeah. It started
this morning.

442
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,133
He had a temp of 101.

443
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,200
Check for cervical adenopathy

444
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,333
and look for infection

445
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,166
particularly
in the ears and throat.

446
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,566
‐ Does that hurt?
‐ Kind of.

447
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,366
It's probably just
a virus, Mrs. Enloe.

448
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,233
I'm gonna give Brad
some ibuprofen

449
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,700
and check his blood count.

450
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:27,166
I see he's a candidate
for immunotoxin therapy.

451
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,100
Yes, but unfortunately

452
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,366
Brad has to be hospitalized
to get the drug

453
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,766
and our insurance company
turned him down.

454
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,033
They won't pay
for experimental treatments.

455
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,566
If his neutrophil count
comes back under 500

456
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,500
we'll admit him
for IV antibiotics.

457
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:43,666
Maybe, he could get the
immunotoxins on the side.

458
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
Is that a possibility?

459
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,266
Well, why don't we
cross that bridge

460
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,666
when the white count
results are back?

461
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,533
Carol, does your clinic
have any information

462
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:59,300
about shelters
for runaways?

463
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,600
Is this for the kid
you saved?

464
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,633
‐ You heard, hmm?
‐ Everyone has.

465
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
I thought you were
supposed to smooth things out

466
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:05,566
between the ER
and paramedics.

467
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,066
I got a little
carried away.

468
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,566
Well, it doesn't matter.
You're still a hero.

469
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,433
Yeah, if I don't
kill him.

470
00:20:11,466 --> 00:20:12,633
What?

471
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,500
He's got
a clotting disorder.

472
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,166
If I treat him
with a blood thinner

473
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,633
he could bleed
to death on the street

474
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,233
and if I let him go
without treatment

475
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,666
he could die
of a blood clot.

476
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,766
Oh, God, between a rock
and a hard place, huh?

477
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,733
Alright, here's
a pamphlet for a shelter

478
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,533
that takes in street kids.

479
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,366
‐ Think you can convince him?
‐ We'll see.

480
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,066
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thanks.

481
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:33,333
Mr. Preston, can I talk
to you for a second?

482
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:35,733
I'll be right back.

483
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,400
I ordered up Kate's
old medical records.

484
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,533
There's a pattern
that needs explaining.

485
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh, okay. But she wasn't
riding a bicycle

486
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,100
but it's not
what you're thinking.

487
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,266
‐ Then what is it?
‐ Um..

488
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:52,500
‐ She was riding a, a unicycle.
‐ A unicycle?

489
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,166
Backwards while
playing the violin.

490
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,766
I didn't want to say anything

491
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,566
because we were trying to break
a Guinness' world record

492
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
and I didn't want
word to get out.

493
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,600
Mm‐hmm.

494
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:02,233
And her split‐lip
two months ago?

495
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,633
Balancing pint glasses
on her chin.

496
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,366
Knife cuts to the hand?

497
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,300
We actually broke
the potato peeling record. Uh..

498
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,400
...look, Kate and I were
going through some tough times.

499
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,600
I started looking
for something

500
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,100
that she and I could
do together.

501
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,366
I know this sounds crazy

502
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,233
but I found
a three‐legged marathon

503
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:17,466
that she and I could enter.

504
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,566
We won and we
kinda got hooked.

505
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,300
Started breaking
all kinds of records.

506
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,033
‐ May I help you?
‐ Yeah.

507
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,033
I'm Peter Benton
from County.

508
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,766
‐ Kerry Weaver referred me.
‐ Oh.

509
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,166
I'm Sara Jackson.
Dr. Parks is in with a patient.

510
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,333
‐ Come on, I'll introduce you.
‐ Hey, uh‐um, excuse me.

511
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:39,766
Now, on the door, it
says "family medicine".

512
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,566
I thought she was
a head and neck surgeon.

513
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,466
No, uh, she has
a family practice.

514
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,733
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi, hi, hi. I'm Dr. Benton.

515
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,633
Listen, don't‐no, don't let me
interrupt your patient.

516
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,233
No, that's not a problem.
I'm happy that you came over.

517
00:21:55,633 --> 00:22:00,266
Um, I'm sorry. Th‐there
must be some misunderstanding.

518
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,366
Oh, no. Kerry told me
about your son.

519
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,133
'I'd be really happy
to discuss cochlear implants.'

520
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,600
And about other options, too.

521
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:13,066
I guess, she didn't tell you
I was deaf, huh?

522
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,500
No, she didn't.

523
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:22,033
Dr. Benton, Dr. Parks asked
that when you speak to her

524
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,133
you look directly at her,
so she can read your lips.

525
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,066
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, uh, look..

526
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
...I‐I said, I didn't know
you were deaf.

527
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,633
That's alright.

528
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,533
'Can we talk?'

529
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,566
'Do you have time
for some coffee?'

530
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,133
Yeah, yeah, alright, yeah.

531
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,533
Alright.

532
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,166
Just let me finish up
with this patient here

533
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,366
and then we'll all go.

534
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,666
‐ Okay.
‐ "Okay".

535
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,066
Great.

536
00:22:51,004 --> 00:22:53,138
I know you must
be very confused

537
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,004
trying to decide
what's best for your son.

538
00:22:56,038 --> 00:22:58,004
Well, look, I want
my son to be able

539
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,138
to function in the world.

540
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:07,371
As you can see, I function
pretty well without an implant.

541
00:23:07,404 --> 00:23:09,638
Yeah, but if an implant
can help him to hear

542
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,038
why not get one?

543
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:17,104
Well, there are
other options.

544
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:20,104
Yeah. Look, I don't want my son

545
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:22,438
to have to depend on others.
No offense.

546
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,571
'Do you know
any deaf people, Dr. Benton?'

547
00:23:29,604 --> 00:23:32,471
No. No, I don't.

548
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:34,438
'Have you ever thought
that being deaf..'

549
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,371
'...might not be so terrible?'

550
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,138
So you're saying
there's no problem?

551
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,904
'You can never know
what it's like being deaf.'

552
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:49,404
'Just like I can never know
what it's like being black.'

553
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,971
I don't look at me
being black as a burden.

554
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:55,371
That's who I am.

555
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:59,038
'And I don't look
at my deafness as a burden.'

556
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,304
'That's who I am.'

557
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:05,138
'If you turn away
from your son's deafness..'

558
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:08,538
'...you will be robbing him
of his identity.'

559
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,038
My son has a medical problem.

560
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:11,238
I'm not turning away
from anything.

561
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:13,271
I'm trying to fix it. Hmm?

562
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,038
Aren't you late
for a budget meeting?

563
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:22,338
Yep, if I can
ever get through

564
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:23,971
this administrative
hellhole

565
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,171
maybe I'll get
to see a few kids again.

566
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,204
You can do it.
Keep going.

567
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:34,871
You're doing great, dad.

568
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:37,338
Beats juggling cantaloupes.

569
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,571
Two hours he's been at it.

570
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:40,271
‐ He hasn't dropped one yet.
‐ Hmm.

571
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,904
Hey, Kate,
the orthopedic surgeon's

572
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,504
gonna come down
and examine your wrist.

573
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:48,638
Is it alright if I watch my dad
till the other doctor gets here?

574
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,571
He's trying to break
the juggling record.

575
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:54,971
Kate, did your dad force you
to ride that unicycle?

576
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:57,938
Force me? Oh, no.
It was my idea.

577
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,471
Well, you've had
a lot of injuries.

578
00:24:59,504 --> 00:25:02,471
Dad and I always take
Guinness‐approved precautions.

579
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:04,271
If you're gonna be
a record‐breaker

580
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:06,038
you've got to take your chances.

581
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,938
Play it safe and life's boring.

582
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:10,604
Here's when we broke
the three‐legged marathon.

583
00:25:10,638 --> 00:25:13,904
That's me and dad.
We're in the book.

584
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:16,004
I'm going to give you
Accutane for the acne

585
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:18,171
but you'll need
to take birth control pills.

586
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:20,004
Birth control pills?

587
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:23,204
Accutane is a very
effective medication.

588
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,571
But if you were to get
pregnant while taking it

589
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,904
it could cause terrible
birth defects to the baby.

590
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:31,004
Oh, I won't have sex.
I promised my mom.

591
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,904
I believe you, Nava.
But it's my policy to give

592
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:37,271
birth control pills to every
girl who takes Accutane, okay?

593
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:39,204
I don't think my mom
will let me take 'em.

594
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,371
You could just have her call me.
I'll explain it to her.

595
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:43,471
I don't think
she'll change her mind.

596
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,638
Okay, then, um..

597
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,571
...I'm afraid, I can't
give you this medication.

598
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:57,004
‐ I brought you these.
‐ Hey, thanks. What's that?

599
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,504
I thought you might
want to read up

600
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:01,538
on the latest treatment advances
on protein S deficiency.

601
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:04,404
Hey, look, I like you,
but I'm really not worth it.

602
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,504
Come. There's a list
of homeless shelters in there.

603
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:11,104
If you can't go home,
you might as well go to one

604
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,971
'cause there, you could
take your Coumadin.

605
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,504
And then what? Maybe, I can
get a job at McDonald's?

606
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:17,538
You're a smart guy.

607
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:19,604
You get a GED.

608
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:21,004
Maybe, go to college.

609
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,904
Hey, look, what's the use?

610
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:24,971
Would you rather die
on the streets?

611
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:32,271
You know, you're cute
when you get angry.

612
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:33,971
Is that the only way
that you can relate to me

613
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:35,438
by turning me
into a customer?

614
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,971
Yeah, okay,
I'll read them.

615
00:26:41,004 --> 00:26:42,304
Anything for you.

616
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,971
Hey.

617
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,871
Can you write me a script
for birth control pills?

618
00:26:49,904 --> 00:26:52,571
Oh, that young lady decided
to take them after all?

619
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:54,538
Yeah, she said
she would.

620
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,171
You know, uh..

621
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:01,404
...you have no business
giving her birth control pills

622
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:03,638
because she and her mom
don't want 'em?

623
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,904
And, uh, what if
she got pregnant?

624
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:07,938
Well, you heard her.
She's not sexually active.

625
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:09,404
She's a teenager.
That doesn't guarantee

626
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:11,004
she's not
gonna have sex.

627
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,138
You...you are
undermining her choice.

628
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:16,638
Giving her birth control pills
is not gonna make her have sex.

629
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:19,504
Listen, how would you feel
if you were that girl

630
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,904
and a white nurse came in
and said she didn't trust you.

631
00:27:21,938 --> 00:27:23,138
Well, you know,
I wouldn't like it at all

632
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:24,638
no matter what color
the nurse was.

633
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:26,571
All I'm saying is,
you don't know that girl

634
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,204
and you don't know her mother.

635
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,685
Well, are you volunteering
to talk her into it?

636
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:32,885
No. Uh‐uh. I just think
it's wrong for you

637
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,085
to try to force
birth control on the girl.

638
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:36,718
Well, maybe.

639
00:27:36,752 --> 00:27:38,885
But I'm not gonna take
any chances.

640
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,118
Oh, Dr. Carter.

641
00:27:40,152 --> 00:27:41,718
Labs are back on Brad Enloe.

642
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:43,785
You should look at them.

643
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:46,952
His neutrophil count's
over 1000. We can't admit him.

644
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,252
Well, at least he's not septic.

645
00:27:48,285 --> 00:27:50,918
Right. He's only dying
of leukemia.

646
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:52,718
He vomited after I
gave him ibuprofen.

647
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:56,152
‐ Really?
‐ Yep.

648
00:27:56,185 --> 00:27:57,918
‐ When?
‐ A couple of minutes ago.

649
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:02,185
He's dehydrated. We're
gonna admit him after all.

650
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:03,918
Malik, would you call
upstairs and tell them

651
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:05,785
we have an admit
for pedes oncology?

652
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:10,585
‐ He only vomited once.
‐ I know. Make the call?

653
00:28:10,618 --> 00:28:13,185
‐ He needs to be rehydrated.
‐ Well, I can start an IV.

654
00:28:13,218 --> 00:28:14,952
I don't think that you
should do one on a kid.

655
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,018
‐ I can do it.
‐ He's been through chemo.

656
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,918
His veins are sclerosed.

657
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:20,018
Not this one.

658
00:28:21,052 --> 00:28:22,718
‐ Hey, Doug.
‐ Hey.

659
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:24,018
Can you write me a script
for birth control pills?

660
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,252
I thought we're swearing
that stuff off.

661
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,752
It's for a patient.

662
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,885
‐ When did you hear?
‐ A half hour ago.

663
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:30,085
Hey, Mark.

664
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,118
Uh, whenever you
have a minute?

665
00:28:32,152 --> 00:28:34,552
Uh, yeah. I'll be
right there.

666
00:28:36,552 --> 00:28:39,852
Kerry knows this ER better than
anybody we could hire.

667
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,985
I agree, but the committee
wants a star

668
00:28:42,018 --> 00:28:43,118
with a national reputation

669
00:28:43,152 --> 00:28:44,685
who can bring in
research grants.

670
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:46,885
Mark, trauma's pulling up.

671
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,152
I'll tell her.

672
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,085
You sure? Mark?

673
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:52,785
No sense in telling Kerry
she was our second choice.

674
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,985
Only disappoint her
even more.

675
00:28:55,018 --> 00:28:56,185
Right.

676
00:28:57,618 --> 00:28:59,252
Alright,
forward, forward.

677
00:28:59,285 --> 00:29:00,718
Here we go.
Here we go.

678
00:29:00,752 --> 00:29:02,718
What the hell?

679
00:29:02,752 --> 00:29:05,185
Two wacko brothers got in an
argument on the expressway

680
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:06,652
and lost control of the van.

681
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:07,985
I've never seen
such a holy mess.

682
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:10,085
You idiot,
I said, turn left.

683
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,852
‐ I'm sorry, Marcus.
‐ You're a jackass.

684
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:14,585
I can't believe I let you drive.
You never watch the road.

685
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,885
Eddy and Marcus Haney,
carpet layers.

686
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:18,918
Several cans of carpet cement
spilled all over.

687
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:20,618
They're stuck to their seat.

688
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,118
Watch yourself. You get stuck,
you're on your own.

689
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:23,852
You're a moron, Eddy,
you know that?

690
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:25,252
‐ Well, just relax.
‐ I know, Marcus.

691
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,585
How can I relax
when that idiot did this?

692
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:30,918
Okay, pulse is strong,
pupils react to light.

693
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,118
Lydia, give me a glove
change over here.

694
00:29:33,152 --> 00:29:34,852
This stuff is like taffy.

695
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:36,052
How's he doing?

696
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:37,685
Whoa.

697
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:39,752
What is it, hmm?

698
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:44,585
Uh. We got an impalement
of some kind.

699
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,218
Oh, my God. It looks like,
it looks like some kind of tool

700
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,985
with sharp prongs.

701
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:50,985
Oh, no. Not the hand stretcher.

702
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:52,218
Four‐by‐fours.

703
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,218
‐ Eddy?
‐ Just don't move so much.

704
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,752
'We're going
to take care of him.'

705
00:29:55,785 --> 00:29:57,652
‐ Oh, man.
‐ We have a bleeding man here.

706
00:29:57,685 --> 00:29:59,685
Let's take him to trauma.

707
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,485
Gently.

708
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:03,752
Malik, try and get
some monitor leads on.

709
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:04,785
How?

710
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:06,085
Get a tongue depressor

711
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:07,785
see if you can scrape off
a few spots.

712
00:30:07,818 --> 00:30:09,552
‐ Why'd Eddy stop talking?
‐ Hold still.

713
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:11,218
If you move another inch,
you could kill him.

714
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,852
‐ Pulse ox is falling.
‐ Stand by with intubation.

715
00:30:13,885 --> 00:30:15,952
I'll get a tray
and an 8.0 ET tube.

716
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,152
I'm covering for Dr. Benton.
Need a consult?

717
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:22,485
We've got an impalement.
Watch out for the glue.

718
00:30:22,518 --> 00:30:25,052
‐ Lucy, have you ever intubated?
‐ No, but I'd like to.

719
00:30:25,085 --> 00:30:27,752
‐ Uh, pretty tough intubation.
‐ Yeah, let's find out.

720
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:28,985
Carter, you'll talk
her through it.

721
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:31,018
Great.

722
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:34,118
Uh, runs of PVCs
when he's jostled.

723
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:36,052
Probably from the impaled
tool against the heart.

724
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,585
‐ Carter, get the crash cart.
‐ Uh, Lydia?

725
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:38,752
‐ 'On it.'
‐ Thank you.

726
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:40,152
Malik, we need
a Sauerbruch cutter here

727
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:41,918
as fast as you can.

728
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:43,685
Hang in there,
Eddy, alright?

729
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:44,952
You're gonna be okay.

730
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,252
Carter, I need you
to come over here

731
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:48,085
and carefully pull
Marcus away

732
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:51,152
so that Lucy has
room to intubate.

733
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,785
‐ Can you get in there?
‐ Yeah, just a little more.

734
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,685
Lydia, grab the camera
and snap some pictures.

735
00:30:56,718 --> 00:30:58,052
New policy everyone

736
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,152
we're documenting
our interesting traumas.

737
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,618
Take her through it, Carter.

738
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:02,852
Alright, now pass the tube.

739
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,885
Not too far.

740
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,818
Alright,
take out the scope

741
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:13,952
pull the stylet

742
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:16,952
confirm your position.

743
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,185
‐ I'm in I think.
‐ Good job.

744
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:21,685
Let's call respiratory
for a vent.

745
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:27,185
‐ I hear good breath sounds.
‐ He's in SVT.

746
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,085
‐ We need to shock him.
‐ Not while they're attached.

747
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:30,652
Try six of Adenocard.

748
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,185
Please save my brother.

749
00:31:32,218 --> 00:31:34,885
‐ Carter, let go.
‐ Ah‐h, I'm stuck.

750
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:36,185
Charging, 200.

751
00:31:36,218 --> 00:31:37,485
Carter, get out
of your gloves

752
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:38,618
get out of your gown.

753
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:39,852
No. My beard is stuck.

754
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,218
'Got the cutters.'

755
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:44,218
Pull back, Carter.

756
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,852
'I need some exposed skin.'

757
00:31:51,985 --> 00:31:53,952
I'm stuck.

758
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:55,252
Okay, ready? And..

759
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:58,485
Clear.

760
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:03,785
Got a pulse.

761
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:06,752
Good job, everybody.
Let's get him to the OR.

762
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:13,952
Still want pictures?

763
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:16,618
Might as well.

764
00:32:16,652 --> 00:32:18,552
Carter?

765
00:32:18,585 --> 00:32:19,585
Carter, you alright?

766
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:20,785
Yeah, I think so.

767
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:22,685
Thank you
for saving my brother.

768
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,218
Just doing our job.

769
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:25,952
We need to extricate Dr. Carter

770
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,252
so Lucy, why don't
you start with his beard?

771
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:38,052
You mean he was juggling
while on a pogo stick?

772
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:39,618
Yeah, a guy in Zurich.

773
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:41,252
What about
while skydiving?

774
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:43,252
Isabella Rishi
from Tangiers

775
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:45,852
holds the record
for juggling five balls.

776
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:47,885
No way. How long
has he been at it?

777
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:49,718
Uh, over
three‐and‐a‐half hours.

778
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:53,152
What's the record? 11 hours,
4 minutes, 22 seconds.

779
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:54,652
It's in the book.

780
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:56,185
Kate's documenting the event.

781
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:58,052
This could be
our first time on TV.

782
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,985
Less than eight hours to go.

783
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:03,118
‐ Dad.
‐ Jerry, watch out.

784
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:05,152
'Hey.'

785
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:09,852
Hey, congratulations.

786
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:12,018
I never thought you'd unstick
the two glue brothers.

787
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:14,585
I guess you can fix
about anything, huh?

788
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,785
We try.

789
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:17,218
Yeah, by the way,
I got a call

790
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,518
that you picked up a kid today,
Kevin Dulaney?

791
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:20,752
We got a warrant
for his arrest.

792
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,085
What for?

793
00:33:22,118 --> 00:33:25,152
Parole violation,
prostitution. The usual.

794
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,652
How long do
you expect to keep him?

795
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:27,985
It's hard to say.

796
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:29,785
We're treating him
for a blood clotting disorder.

797
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:30,985
Give me a call when
you're ready to release him.

798
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,718
I'll have a unit waitin'
to pick him up.

799
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:34,885
Yeah, I'm a doctor.
I'm not a cop.

800
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:38,118
He needs a second chance.

801
00:33:38,152 --> 00:33:40,018
I'm a cop, not a social worker.

802
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,885
You're doing your job,
I'm doing mine.

803
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,552
If this kid gets beat up in
jail, he could bleed to death.

804
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:47,185
If I don't pick him up,
somebody else will.

805
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:48,618
Now, I'll have
a sitter to guard him

806
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:49,818
until you give him
a clean bill of health.

807
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:54,952
Good job on the trauma.

808
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,917
You came pretty close.

809
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,183
Ah, we'll try
again later, huh?

810
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,850
‐ Hey.
‐ Hi.

811
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:07,750
Is, uh, Kate ready
to be discharged?

812
00:34:07,783 --> 00:34:09,683
Well, yeah. Just bring her back
in a week for a cast check.

813
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:10,717
Okay. No jumping
around, though, right?

814
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,983
Not for at least six weeks.

815
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,217
Okay. I want to thank
you for being so kind.

816
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,250
You're welcome.

817
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:15,750
‐ Thanks.
‐ Okay. Bye.

818
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:17,283
But I'll miss tonight's event
at the pier.

819
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:18,650
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

820
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:19,783
You want to go watch?

821
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:21,783
‐ I guess.
‐ Okay.

822
00:34:23,817 --> 00:34:25,650
Brad's bed is ready.

823
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,383
I've written orders
for the oncology unit

824
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,850
to continue
to rehydrate him.

825
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,050
Thank you, Dr. Carter.

826
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:34,983
You should feel fine
in a couple of days.

827
00:34:35,017 --> 00:34:36,317
Good luck with your
new treatment.

828
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,317
‐ Thanks.
‐ Malik, can you take him out?

829
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,183
Yeah, sure.

830
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:42,783
He isn't dehydrated, is he?

831
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:45,650
‐ He vomited, I gave him fluids.
‐ What will oncology say?

832
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,117
All they want is a diagnosis

833
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,717
to justify Brad's admission,
I gave him one dehydration.

834
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,117
Can you give him an IV
even if he doesn't need one?

835
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,650
It was the only way
to get him admitted.

836
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:55,283
‐ So, you lied?
‐ Technically, yeah.

837
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:57,150
Sometimes you got
to work the system.

838
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:58,317
You lied?

839
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,150
Mrs. Enloe, I didn't
know you were there.

840
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,350
Dr. Carter, is it true
Brad's not dehydrated?

841
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:05,950
Look, it's a way for him
to get the chemo.

842
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:07,950
What if my insurance
company finds out?

843
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,317
I see no reason
why they should.

844
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,317
I do, they already challenged
three of our claims

845
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,350
and if they find
out about this

846
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:13,883
Brad could lose
his coverage.

847
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,717
Then what do we do when
his leukemia gets worse?

848
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,317
Mrs. Enloe, I don't
see any other way

849
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,350
of going about
doing this.

850
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,783
I'll talk to you later.

851
00:35:21,817 --> 00:35:23,983
Cop stopped by earlier.

852
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:26,983
Still wants to take you
in after I discharge you.

853
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:28,250
What did you tell him?

854
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:30,350
That you were sick.

855
00:35:30,383 --> 00:35:31,917
Are they going
to put me in juvie?

856
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,117
They want to.

857
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,817
I can't go back
to that place.

858
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,717
I'm like a punching
bag for those guys.

859
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,250
I know.

860
00:35:38,283 --> 00:35:40,117
I gotta tell you
getting heparinized

861
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,783
is the best treatment.

862
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:43,050
That's great,
listen, I‐I can't

863
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,717
stick around here
if the cops are coming.

864
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,683
Figured you'd say that.

865
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,217
Are you setting me up?

866
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:05,117
If your leg starts
to hurt

867
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,250
or gets swollen,
you have to come back.

868
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:10,217
Here's 50 bucks
and my pager number.

869
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,617
Coumadin and a
list of shelters.

870
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,283
I never promised you
I'd take that stuff.

871
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,850
I know.

872
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,050
Maybe I'll see
you around, huh?

873
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,217
Hey, Peter, you missed
a great trauma.

874
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,850
Yeah? I was out
talking to Dr. Parks.

875
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,150
‐ What did you think of her?
‐ Well, you know.

876
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,317
She had the audacity to tell me
that Reese needs to be around

877
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,850
other deaf kids more than
he needs to be with me.

878
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,217
Yeah, I, uh..

879
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,317
...you know, I should
have warned you.

880
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,017
Lisa has very
strong opinions.

881
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,350
Opinions?

882
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:11,750
Well, she doesn't
mind being deaf.

883
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:13,317
She doesn't want
to be cured.

884
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,017
But I thought you'd want
to see what she's achieved.

885
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,950
Well, Look, I don't want my
son to live with a defect

886
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,217
if he doesn't have to.

887
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,850
Defect?

888
00:37:21,883 --> 00:37:24,817
What do you mean by that?

889
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,617
It means, what I do with my
son is my business, alright?

890
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,850
Be sure and let me know
how things work out, okay?

891
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,750
‐ God bless you, sweetheart.
‐ Oh.

892
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,317
I, uh, thought
the nursing home said

893
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,017
they wouldn't have a bed
available until tomorrow.

894
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,050
Well, Stan's
not going there.

895
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,850
What you said
earlier was right.

896
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:43,717
You need to know the
patient's community.

897
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,283
So, I called
his temple.

898
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,150
Another member with diabetes
said he'd stay with Stan

899
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,283
until he found
a new health aide.

900
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:49,917
Good idea.

901
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,650
Doesn't hurt to do
a little outreach.

902
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,617
Mr. Kloner will be
staying with you.

903
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,017
What's that son of a
bitch doing here?

904
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,717
I should have known.

905
00:38:00,783 --> 00:38:01,817
'I spit on your grave!'

906
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:03,350
I'll see you
dead first!

907
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:06,183
You owe me 20 grand
for that time share in Florida!

908
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,783
'It's a shack in the swamp.'

909
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,383
There you are.

910
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:13,983
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

911
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,250
I'm kind of late
for an appointment, so‐‐

912
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,017
What happened with Brad?

913
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,217
His mom took him home.

914
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,417
She decided not to risk it.

915
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,750
I'm sorry to hear that.

916
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:28,050
Me, too.

917
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:29,783
I wouldn't have asked
so many questions

918
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:31,983
if you had told me
what you were doing.

919
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,117
Well, I'm sorry
that you thought

920
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,250
it was your business
to ask me.

921
00:38:36,283 --> 00:38:38,717
What's going to happen?

922
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,183
He's gonna die.

923
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,250
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, Mark.

924
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:55,983
I was just
putting together

925
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,117
a year‐long coverage
schedule for the ER.

926
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,650
Ah, good.

927
00:38:59,683 --> 00:39:00,817
Kerry, I wanna talk to you.

928
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,183
Is it about
the chief position?

929
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,783
The executive committee has
decided to reopen the search.

930
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,183
Oh.

931
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,250
The committee feels
that they need a candidate

932
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,850
with a national reputation.

933
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:19,850
Personally, I
think it stinks.

934
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:26,017
Well, that's that.

935
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,883
You're not out of the
running, Kerry.

936
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,650
It's, it's just
reopened the search.

937
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:32,150
No.

938
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:33,417
And I'm not interested

939
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,083
in continuing
as interim chief.

940
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,217
‐ Who's gonna do it?
‐ Not my problem.

941
00:39:41,183 --> 00:39:42,283
I know I shouldn't
have yelled at him

942
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:44,250
but he's just so
damn sensitive.

943
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:47,017
Hold still, Marcus.

944
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,283
Hey, welcome back.

945
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:50,983
I hear I missed
quite a trauma.

946
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:52,383
You certainly did.

947
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:53,850
It's all my fault.

948
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,183
Eddy was driving and
I upset him, and..

949
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:58,983
Well, I was just upstairs.
They finished the surgery.

950
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:00,783
Look, they repaired the wound
to your brother's heart.

951
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:03,950
‐ He's gonna be fine.
‐ Oh, thank God!

952
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:06,983
It was Dr. Corday here
who freed him just in time.

953
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:09,850
Oh. Well, that doesn't
surprise me.

954
00:40:09,883 --> 00:40:12,683
She's an excellent doctor.

955
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:14,017
Listen, when you're
finished with Marcus

956
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,850
we'll grab dinner.

957
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,783
I beg your pardon?

958
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,417
You're my new intern.

959
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,783
I just gave you an order.

960
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:24,750
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

961
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:30,317
Peter, are you sure?

962
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,917
Elizabeth, you're no intern.

963
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,317
Yeah, you'll still have
to do some scut work

964
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,817
and take call
every third night

965
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,650
but you'll still have
your own patients

966
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:38,983
and you get to operate
with me.

967
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:41,283
Thank you.

968
00:40:41,317 --> 00:40:42,417
Yeah.

969
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,050
Don't mention it.

970
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,650
I'll see you later.

971
00:40:45,683 --> 00:40:47,717
Aren't you on tonight?

972
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,783
Yeah.

973
00:40:48,817 --> 00:40:50,750
I am.

974
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,917
‐ Hey.
‐ Hmm.

975
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,350
Are you sure you don't want me
to get you something to eat?

976
00:40:59,383 --> 00:41:00,383
I can run over
to Doc Magoo's.

977
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:01,917
No, it's alright

978
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,950
I got indigestion there
at lunch.

979
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,750
What are you doing?

980
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:08,883
Well, I made the mistake
of opening my big mouth.

981
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,150
I told Anspaugh that pedes ER

982
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,083
was running at peak capacity

983
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,050
so now he wants me to give
a detailed analysis

984
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:16,250
of the daily census.

985
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:21,777
‐ When will you be home?
‐ Uh, around April.

986
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:25,111
I won't wait up then.

987
00:41:25,144 --> 00:41:26,344
‐ Go home.
‐ Goodnight.

988
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:27,777
Goodnight.

989
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:35,872
Hey, doc, where you headed?

990
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:37,239
Home, you?

991
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:39,139
Back to the firehouse,
we're off duty.

992
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:40,639
Listen, uh..

993
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:43,072
...sorry I broke
protocol this morning.

994
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:45,006
I think the adrenaline
got the best of me.

995
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,139
Usually happens to me
in a couple of hours.

996
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,306
My knees won't
stop shaking.

997
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:52,172
‐ You got any cash on you?
‐ I'm tapped out.

998
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:55,039
A bunch of us are playing
poker tonight, wanna come?

999
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:56,239
Sure.

1000
00:41:56,272 --> 00:41:58,206
We'll stop by
the ready teller.

1001
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,239
Hop in.

1002
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:01,039
Right.

1003
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,739
What's the time
we have to beat?

1004
00:42:11,772 --> 00:42:13,739
Uh, six hours and
twenty nine minutes.

1005
00:42:13,772 --> 00:42:15,706
We're trying to set
a new world record.

1006
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:16,906
You're doing great, Jeanie.

1007
00:42:16,939 --> 00:42:18,006
Thanks for stepping in, Kate.

1008
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:19,372
My pleasure.

1009
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,272
Only six hours twenty four
minutes to go, right?

1010
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:22,306
That's right.

1011
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,339
‐ Whoo!
‐ Cool.

1012
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:24,672
‐ Whoo!
‐ Whoo‐hoo!

1013
00:42:35,872 --> 00:42:37,639
♪ In my.. ♪

1014
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:38,839
Dr. Weaver?

1015
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:40,206
Carter.

1016
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,239
Uh.

1017
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:42,806
What are you..

1018
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,206
What are you doing here?

1019
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,306
I came to see
about a room for rent.

1020
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:50,939
Is this the right address?

1021
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:52,339
It is, I..

1022
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,939
...I rent out my apartment.

1023
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,639
I've a basement.

1024
00:42:59,172 --> 00:43:01,072
Would you like to see it?

1025
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,906
Um...sure.

1026
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:06,739
You know, I don't usually
advertise at the hospital

1027
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:09,972
because I always thought
it might be kind of, um..

1028
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:11,072
...you know, awkward.

1029
00:43:11,106 --> 00:43:13,039
Ah. Sure.

1030
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:14,806
Well, hey,
if you'd‐if you'd rather not..

1031
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:17,906
No.

1032
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:18,972
I was just..

1033
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:21,106
I was just, uh,
having a drink.

1034
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,872
Would you like one?

1035
00:43:27,206 --> 00:43:29,206
‐ Sure.
‐ Good.

1036
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:30,339
Good.

1037
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:39,306
Did you do something
to your hair?

1038
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:46,006
Hello.

1039
00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:47,039
Hey, baby.

1040
00:43:48,872 --> 00:43:51,039
Oh, your census report,
no I..

1041
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:54,972
Yeah, I think it's on,
the kitchen table, yeah.

1042
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:56,372
You want me to get it for you?

1043
00:43:56,406 --> 00:43:57,806
No, no, no, no.
I can do it.

1044
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:58,839
It's just gonna
take me a minute.

1045
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,806
Okay, so just hold on, do..

1046
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:02,272
Don't get out
of the tub.

1047
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,039
You look all happy.

1048
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:05,806
Doug!

1049
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,039
What are you doing here?

1050
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:08,839
I came in with this

1051
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,072
but then I was thinking,
you know

1052
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,072
that I was working
all night last night.

1053
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:15,106
You were?

1054
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:16,272
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And?

1055
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:17,939
I'm gonna be working
all day tomorrow.

1056
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:19,706
Yeah?

1057
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,339
So, maybe I should
take tonight off.

1058
00:44:21,372 --> 00:44:23,006
I think that's
a good idea.

1059
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:24,672
‐ You like that?
‐ Mm‐hm.

1060
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,139
Is that a bubble bath?

1061
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:33,106
‐ Want to come in?
‐ Mm‐hm.
