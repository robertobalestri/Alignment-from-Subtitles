can improve our department?

00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,700
Well, right away,
you could benefit

observation unit.

as impressive in the room

00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,066
she just might
be our next chief.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,600
Dr. Corday,
you gave him 50%.

10
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,366
My God, you're right!
I've given him a lethal dose!

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,433
‐ He's bradying down, hurry!
‐ Number 8 ET tube!

he's a candidate.

don't feel the need

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,433

00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:17,800
Dr. Greene,
they need you in radiology.

176
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,100
I'll be right there.

177
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,333
You could use
a light day, Carter.

178
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,666
Yeah, you're not quite up to

179
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,233
speed yet with
your shoulder yet, right?

180
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:25,800
Guess I'll just
finish this paperwork.

181
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,200
Thanks. I appreciate it.

182
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:30,600
She's got a big wind‐up

183
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:32,333
then she just nails it
right over the plate.

184
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:33,600
I can deal with that.

185
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,400
Jimmy's got
an earache and Erlene's

186
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:36,466
got this funny‐looking
sore right here

187
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,733
in the middle of her lip.

188
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,266
Okay, we'll check 'em
out, Mrs. La Bahtray.

189
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,800
Lucy, why don't you
start with Jimmy?

190
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,700
Hey, Doug? We've got an
eight‐year‐old coming in.

191
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:44,466
Auto versus bicycle.

192
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,300
Okay, I'm with you. Lucy,
you got this under control?

193
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,800
‐ Yeah, no problem.
‐ Alright.

194
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,333
Get away from me.
I don't like that.

195
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:50,500
‐ Oh, Jimmy, you stop that now.
‐ Oh, sweetie..

196
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,166
I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,666
I don't want
her doing that.

198
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,633
Do you want me to hold him down?
That's what I usually do.

199
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,633
Oh, no, it's okay, a nurse
will come in anytime.

200
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,666
Get off me, ma!

201
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,033
Okay, we're ready for you.

202
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,500
Ma! Get off me!

203
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,100
Wilson Geary, eight‐years‐old.

204
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:05,566
Crossing Morrison on his bike.
Hit by a car.

205
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,766
He was chasing us.
I didn't see the car.

206
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,433
It's okay, Wilson,
we're gonna take care of you.

207
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,033
'Everything's
gonna be just fine.'

208
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,633
Good vitals, no LOC,
complains of belly pain

209
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,366
lot's of road rash, possible
fracture on the left hand.

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,366
Alright, let's get that buckle?

211
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,233
On my count.
One, two, three.

212
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,466
I didn't see
what happened to Andy.

213
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,633
I just tried to get away.

214
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,733
He keeps talking about some guy

215
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:26,066
chasing him and his friend.

216
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,333
BP 120/72, pulse 94.

217
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:29,433
Okay, Wilson, we're gonna take

218
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,800
some scissors
and cut your clothes

219
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,033
so we can see
where you're hurt, alright?

220
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,600
Okay.

221
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,433
Cops are looking for some
other kid, taking a report

222
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:36,800
from the driver,
and they'll be in after that.

223
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,233
'Alright, thank you, Doris.'

224
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,600
Wilson, you remember
what happened?

225
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,166
I was riding across the park.

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,166
I got into the street,
and there was a car.

227
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,633
I know I must look both ways
but I was trying to get away.

228
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,233
‐ Get away from who?
‐ This man.

229
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,500
He was chasing me and Andy.

230
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,266
Good breath sounds.
Trachea midline.

231
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
‐ Pulse ox is 98.
‐ Tell me if it hurts here.

232
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,466
‐ No.
‐ Okay, how about here?

233
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
‐ Yes. That hurts a lot.
‐ 'Okay.'

234
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,166
'Alright, right upper quadrant
tenderness with guarding.'

235
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,633
'Let's get an abdominal
CT with contrast.'

236
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,033
'Hemoglobin is 13.8.'

237
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,100
‐ Ouch!
‐ I'm sorry.

238
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,766
Was I tugging too hard?

239
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,366
'Doug, got another
kid coming in.'

240
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,433
Eight‐year‐old, GSW.
To the abdomen.

241
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,200
What did she say? Is that Andy?

242
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,133
Hang on a minute, buddy,
why don't you just hold still?

243
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,600
'Let's worry about
you first, okay?'

244
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,633
'Don't move your head.'

245
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,033
You just hang in there.

246
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,400
‐ You're doing great.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

247
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Hey.

248
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,233
Hi.

249
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:30,800
Uh, pre‐op labs are
back on the gallbladder.

250
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,200
'Lap choly's scheduled
for this afternoon.'

251
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:35,533
We're still waiting on
the films for the ischemic bowel

252
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:38,533
and the aortobifemoral bypass
went south with pneumonia

253
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:39,800
ten days post‐op.

254
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,200
Yeah, I know.
I spoke to the family.

255
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,600
What's this?
You're prepping for your M&M?

256
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,166
Yeah, patient's heart rate,
blood pressure, pulse ox

257
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,433
time of magnesium injection

258
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,100
central line placed,
pacemaker captured.

259
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,566
After witnessing your M&M
on Dr. Swanson last year

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,033
I thought it best
to be well‐prepared.

261
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,466
Yeah, well, I don't think
it's gonna go like that.

262
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
‐ Neither do I, but..
‐ You know‐‐

263
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,666
Dr. Benton. Dr. Kotlowitz
was looking for you.

264
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,800
The Shimaharas are here.

265
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,333
Oh, damn.

266
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, um, I'll be
right there, Shirley.

267
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,466
Kotlowitz is putting a cochlear
implant into a three‐year‐old.

268
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,333
I got to go and observe.

269
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,366
I've never seen one.

270
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,233
Yeah, well, neither have I.

271
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,600
Listen, if you need somebody

272
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,166
to bounce that
stuff off of, I..

273
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,466
Oh, Peter, Peter, go.

274
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,533
I'm busy, and you've
got work to do as well.

275
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,566
I'll be there, Elizabeth.

276
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,300
I know you will.

277
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,433
Thanks.

278
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:39,200
'One, two, three.'

279
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,633
'Single gunshot
wound to the abdomen.'

280
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,766
'Found him
pulseless and apneic.'

281
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,266
Asystole on the monitor.

282
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,800
Two rounds of epi
and atropine given.

283
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,300
A liter of saline in.

284
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,400
What's the down time?

285
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,466
About 30 minutes.

286
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,433
I told the cops
to wait outside.

287
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,766
Thoracotomy tray.
O‐neg on the rapid infuser.

288
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,466
I'll do a cut down.
Last epi?

289
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,733
Five minutes ago.

290
00:10:56,766 --> 00:10:58,266
Go with high dose
three milligrams.

291
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,433
'Do you need anything else?'

292
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,333
‐ No, we got it.
‐ Come on.

293
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,800
Hey, Pam,
did you get a name?

294
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,266
'Unconscious from the get‐go.'

295
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,133
Okay, thanks.

296
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,133
Excuse me, excuse me, nurse.

297
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,800
Is that the kid hit by
the car, Wilson Geary?

298
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,300
I need to talk to him.

299
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,033
Ah, we're still
working on him. What happened?

300
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:17,100
I don't know, responded
to the vehicular accident.

301
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,266
The kid on the bike
was pretty shaken.

302
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,633
Paramedics no sooner
got him in the rig

303
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,033
then we found
the other one in the park.

304
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,466
Did you get a name?

305
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,766
Yeah. We got this.

306
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
We contacted his parents.

307
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,333
And what about
Wilson's family?

308
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,566
Working on it.

309
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
‐ Thanks.
‐ Sure.

310
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,266
‐ Andy. Andy!
‐ Buddy.

311
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,633
Hey, listen, you gotta look

312
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,200
at me right now, okay?

313
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:38,533
We gotta fix you up first.

314
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:40,500
‐ Alright?
‐ Okay.

315
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,066
‐ Doing a thoracotomy.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

316
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
‐ Asystole?
‐ 30 minutes.

317
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,166
‐ You got this?
‐ Yep.

318
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
Alright, Wilson, I'll be back
in a little bit, alright?

319
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,733
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

320
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:51,200
What are they doing?

321
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,766
They're trying to help him.

322
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,266
Are they cutting his clothes off
and stuff like you did to me?

323
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,200
Yeah, that's right.

324
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,600
You ready to go for a ride?

325
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,100
'We're going to
roll you down the hall'

326
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,300
'and take
a picture of your belly.'

327
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,500
‐ Okay.
‐ 'Okay.'

328
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:04,366
Dr. Anspaugh's not here.

329
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,233
Shirley, that's a lie 'cause
I just checked his schedule.

330
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:08,066
‐ He doesn't wanna see you.
‐ I just need a minute.

331
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
‐ In the middle of a Whipple?
‐ I just wanna talk to him.

332
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,633
Have you lost your mind?

333
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,266
‐ Carter, be a good soldier.
‐ Two seconds, Shirley.

334
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,466
They're thataway.

335
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,700
Hi. I'm looking
for Ruth Johnson?

336
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:37,033
Oh, uh, say,
a‐are you the doc?

337
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:38,333
I've got a mole right
here back of my neck‐‐

338
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:41,633
‐ Edgar, stop your mole talk!
‐ Oh..

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,666
I'm Ruth Johnson.

340
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,666
Gilda here had
to use the bathroom

341
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,133
and you know how
the young ones

342
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,533
like someone
to take 'em.

343
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:52,566
Nana, please.

344
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
Hi. I'm Gilda Bernucci.

345
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,433
Married an Italian.

346
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,466
I guess we all
know what that means.

347
00:12:58,766 --> 00:13:01,133
Are you the ambassador?

348
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,300
I guess so.

349
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,500
As you see,
I don't need that thing

350
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,666
but, uh, it seems
to make everyone else happy.

351
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,800
Oh. Feels good anyway.

352
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,033
Are you in?

353
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:19,466
Yeah! Just a minute.

354
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,800
Okay, then,
let's take a tour.

355
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,800
Hey, Jerry,
can you page Dr. Ross

356
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,300
when the films get
back on Wilson Geary?

357
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,700
‐ You got it.
‐ Thanks.

358
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:28,733
‐ Can I talk to somebody?
‐ Excuse me again.

359
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,600
Gunshot kid, Andy Stiles,
his parents are here.

360
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:32,233
Okay. I'm gonna go
get Dr. Weaver.

361
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah, actually, it's
his mom and her boyfriend.

362
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,400
Parents are divorced.

363
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,633
Well, what about
Wilson's family?

364
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,666
In Dallas on a business trip.

365
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm trying to track 'em down.

366
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:39,800
He was staying
at Andy's house.

367
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,133
‐ Alright.
‐ Thanks for your help.

368
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,500
Sure.

369
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,666
Hey, Kerry?

370
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,566
Andy's mother
is waiting in chairs.

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,266
Okay. I'll go talk
to her in a minute.

372
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,166
Malik? She might
want to come back.

373
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I'll clean him up.

374
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,200
How's the other boy doing?

375
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,800
I don't know.
He's just back from CT.

376
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,300
Has anyone talked to him yet?

377
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,700
The family's out of town.

378
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,500
Well, if Doug's
busy, let me know.

379
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,500
Alright. Thanks.

380
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:16,600
Hey, Wilson.

381
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,100
How you doing?

382
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,433
Okay.

383
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:22,266
Hey, Andy can have
that bed there.

384
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,133
Uh‐huh.

385
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,133
How did you like the CT?

386
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,433
It was no big deal.

387
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,200
I have a little extra time

388
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:35,500
I thought maybe
you and I could talk.

389
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:37,300
Okay.

390
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,633
Okay.

391
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,533
Don't ask.

392
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:52,200
I won't, but it's
the highlight of my day.

393
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:54,400
Perhaps I should wait
for another elevator.

394
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:55,666
Good idea.

395
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,000
'Lizzie.'

396
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:05,433
I'm glad to see you're in
such good spirits on this

397
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,633
your day of reckoning.

398
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,433
Oh, I'm sure it'll be fine.

399
00:15:08,466 --> 00:15:10,400
Well, you've got me
on your side.

400
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,033
I didn't think it
was a matter of sides

401
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:13,633
simply the examination
of the event.

402
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,666
That's just
the attitude to go in with.

403
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,433
Well, in case, uh,
we don't see each other

404
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:19,766
again before
the conference, uh..

405
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,033
Well..

406
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,166
Best of luck.

407
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,066
'Fracture of
the fourth mid phalanx.'

408
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
I'll put a finger
splint on it.

409
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,500
Any word from the parents?

410
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,533
They're on their
way from Dallas.

411
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,700
I just don't know when.

412
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,666
Hmm. Broken finger
and some road rash.

413
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,533
All things considered,
the kid's lucky.

414
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,800
Not really.

415
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,700
'That's pretty funny, isn't it?'

416
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,033
Kind of amazing really.

417
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,233
'Hi, I'm Carol Hathaway.'

418
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,266
Detective Wilson,
Chicago PD.

419
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,100
Young Wilson here and I
were just laughing about how

420
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,566
we both have the same name.

421
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,766
Oh, that doesn't
happen often.

422
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,333
It's not the same
it's my first name.

423
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:08,733
Right. Look, I need to ask
you a few questions, Wilson.

424
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:10,233
She doesn't
have to leave, does she?

425
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:13,133
Nope. I'm gonna
stay right here.

426
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:16,533
I'd like you to tell me about
what happened in the park.

427
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:18,766
'Someone hurt your friend
Andy, right?'

428
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,366
She said Andy was dead.

429
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,133
Yeah, Wilson, he is dead.

430
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,333
And you saw the man
who was chasing him?

431
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:27,766
Chasing you?

432
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,433
Can you tell me if he was..

433
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:37,600
...White, or Black,
Latino, or maybe Asian?

434
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:40,700
‐ 'Do you know what those mean?'
‐ Yeah.

435
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,200
So which one was he?

436
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:49,666
Wilson, did you know this man?

437
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,333
'Do you recognize him, maybe
seen him in the park before?'

438
00:16:53,366 --> 00:16:55,800
The police just want to find
the man who did this, okay?

439
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,100
So anything
you tell them can help.

440
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,033
I don't know.

441
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:05,333
Well, was he a tall guy
or a short guy?

442
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,200
‐ Kinda tall, maybe.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

443
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,466
Did he come up on
you all of a sudden

444
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,033
or maybe you
noticed him earlier?

445
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,666
He just came up
all of a sudden.

446
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,466
When are my mom
and dad getting here?

447
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,733
'You said they were coming.'

448
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:19,333
They are, they're on
their way, okay?

449
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,266
'They're gonna get here
as soon as they can.'

450
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:29,633
You haven't gotten off
the surgical floor yet?

451
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,066
We're back on
the surgical floor.

452
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
It's their favorite.

453
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,033
They'd like to
observe an operation

454
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,300
if that's at all possible

455
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,666
something in
the open‐heart variety.

456
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,433
Oh, settle down, now,
Carter, this won't kill you.

457
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:43,466
Is, uh.. She, you know, uh..

458
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:45,366
Pretty well out of it?

459
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
No, not at all.

460
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,433
She just has a tendency

461
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,333
to doze off unannounced.

462
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,166
Right. Well, carry on.

463
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,200
I'm awake.

464
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:02,133
Just playing possum.
I'm sick of meeting people.

465
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,100
Can we get outta here?

466
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:06,500
I don't know
where we'd all fit.

467
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,733
Oh, not them, us.

468
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:12,066
Once the implant's in place
we'll repair the pericardium.

469
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
We'll suture the flap and after
Patrick's hair grows back

470
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,600
you'll never even know
we were in there.

471
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:17,333
Except he'll
be able to hear.

472
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,800
Yeah, what we'll do is, activate
the device in a few months.

473
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,033
So, uh, if you'll
excuse me a minute.

474
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,500
Uh, he seems excellent.

475
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's terrific.

476
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,100
He's very aggressive.

477
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:30,600
Aggressive?

478
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,366
Well, I mean, um..

479
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,033
...as in accomplished.

480
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,633
So, um I guess
you guys, you tried

481
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,166
every other option
for Patrick, huh?

482
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,100
Uh, we've done
the hearing aids

483
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,300
uh, intensive oral training,
speech training

484
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,466
looked into special teachers,
special schools.

485
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,600
We know this isn't a cure.

486
00:18:46,633 --> 00:18:49,433
No, no. But.. Man..

487
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,066
He'll be able to
hear a range of sounds.

488
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,666
Mister and Missus Shimahara?

489
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,733
Hi. Here you go.

490
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,133
We're gonna take him
down to pre‐op in a bit

491
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,633
but I thought in the meantime..

492
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,300
‐ Thank you.
‐ Alright. I'll see you.

493
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,433
There's my boy.

494
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,366
Hey, Patrick. Hey, big guy!

495
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Is this okay?

496
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:08,233
You're not too cold?

497
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:10,566
Not too cold.

498
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,766
This is a bit
better view, I think.

499
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,566
At my age, anything
vertical will do just fine.

500
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,766
So how does it feel
to have 100 birthdays?

501
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,666
Downright appalling.

502
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,300
I'm so old,
I can practically remember

503
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,133
when this river
ran the other direction.

504
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,500
That's right.
That's right, they changed it.

505
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:34,566
My husband Everett
used to love this river.

506
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,700
Staring down at it
from 20 stories high.

507
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,400
He worked in one of
these buildings here?

508
00:19:41,433 --> 00:19:43,733
Built 'em.

509
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,633
Construction spree
after the first war.

510
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,800
Even worked on the
Chicago Board of Trade Building.

511
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,566
We did real well.
Sent every child to college

512
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,333
whether they wanted
to go or not.

513
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,300
Well, they must
have appreciated it.

514
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,500
They seem pretty devoted.

515
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:01,033
Family should be.

516
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,266
Some are more than others.

517
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,733
My mom and dad, they, uh..

518
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:08,600
...they tend to
travel quite a bit.

519
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,500
Oh, don't tell me your sad tale.

520
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:15,133
I hear enough of
that at Happy Valley.

521
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,500
'"My kids hate me.
I hate my kids."'

522
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,133
"My son never visits me."

523
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,266
‐ On and on.
‐ I know.

524
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,500
'Given that you never
know what you're gonna get'

525
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:27,633
Everett and I were darn lucky
in what we begot.

526
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:33,800
Well, I suppose
we should be heading back.

527
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,166
They're all
terrified I'm gonna die

528
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,533
before they get
this picture taken.

529
00:20:37,566 --> 00:20:39,533
Okay.

530
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,433
‐ Doug?
‐ Hmm.

531
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,033
Andy Stile's mom
and her boyfriend‐‐

532
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,733
Hey, are you the ones
who helped Wilson?

533
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,566
Yeah.

534
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,233
I'm Judy Stiles, Andy's mother.

535
00:20:51,266 --> 00:20:52,533
Mm‐hmm.

536
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:55,266
This is Carl Dayton.

537
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,566
We're very sorry.

538
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,733
We didn't think it
would take this long

539
00:20:57,766 --> 00:20:59,266
to make all
the arrangements.

540
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,666
We want to see Wilson.

541
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,166
He could probably
use a familiar face.

542
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,433
I think he might
be sleeping right now.

543
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:05,066
I just want to
see how he's doing.

544
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,300
We wanna talk to him.

545
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,700
Well, he hasn't
said very much.

546
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,366
'The police were here earlier.'

547
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
What'd he tell 'em?

548
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,600
He said he couldn't
remember anything.

549
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:14,466
Please..

550
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,033
...he was the last
person to see my son.

551
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
Alright.

552
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:22,666
‐ Okay, well for a few minutes.
‐ Alright.

553
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,666
Hey, Wilson.

554
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,533
Wilson, some people who
know you wanna see you.

555
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:35,633
What?

556
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,566
Hi, Wilson.

557
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,766
How you doing?

558
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
I don't know.

559
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,566
I don't remember
what happened.

560
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
I know. Th‐that's okay, sweetie.

561
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,533
‐ You boys skip school again?
‐ Carl..

562
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:47,200
'If they didn't get
into so much trouble..'

563
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,466
Now, how many times
did I have to warn..

564
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,166
You'll never have
to do it again!

565
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,566
Sorry.
We shouldn't have skipped.

566
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,366
I'm really sorry.

567
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:05,800
‐ I think we need to go.
‐ Alright.

568
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,566
Your mom and‐and your dad
are gonna be here real soon.

569
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,766
I know you're gonna
be just fine.

570
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,200
Hey, it's okay, Wilson.

571
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:15,766
It's okay.

572
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Shh.

573
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:27,809
You know how patients
always postpone

574
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:29,076
right before the holidays.

575
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:30,776
There's nothing like
that prospect of surgery

576
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,776
to make fruitcakes
seem like a good idea, huh?

577
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:32,909
Yeah, right.

578
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:35,276
So I can fit in
Reese next Tuesday.

579
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:36,743
Well, aren't you
concerned about his age?

580
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:38,109
He doesn't fit
the FDA Requirements.

581
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:40,176
No it's been
lowered to 18 months.

582
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,243
Yeah, but I mean his residual
hearing is still high.

583
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,876
Well he's right on the bubble
but we can push that.

584
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,643
We can.. Lo‐look,
he‐here's the thing.

585
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:47,943
'We know it's not gonna improve,
so the sooner he can orient'

586
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,567
himself to a hearing world
the better, right, huh?

587
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,667
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

588
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,600
So, uh, let‐let's put..

589
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,667
...Reese Benton on my schedule,
uh, for a cochlear implant

590
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,867
next Tuesday a. m.

591
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
Good.

592
00:23:00,633 --> 00:23:01,800
Good, good. How we doing?

593
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,667
Ah, Peter,
you know Alex Babcock?

594
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,833
‐ Yeah, anesthesiologist.
‐ 'Good to see you.'

595
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:06,867
'How'd we do?'

596
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,567
Kid sailed through pre‐op.

597
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,833
Fentanyl Oralet,
a little versed

598
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,400
paralyzed
and intubated in a snap.

599
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,767
'And ho‐how'd the parents do?'

600
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
'They could have used a couple'

601
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:16,400
'of lollipops themselves.'

602
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:19,533
'Okay, Peter,
so I'm going to implant'

603
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:23,367
'the electrode directly out
of the linea temporalis'

604
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,133
and then, I'm gonna put
the microphone holder

605
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:28,133
right behind the ear.

606
00:23:28,167 --> 00:23:31,667
I'm gonna inject Lidocaine
and I'm going to make

607
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,367
a flap two centimeters

608
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,333
from where I
insert the device.

609
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:40,233
And I'm gonna cut through
the muscle and the pericranium

610
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:43,233
so the flap will
come right off the skull.

611
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:45,333
Alex, you going back
to Aspen for Christmas?

612
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:46,700
No. Too many snowboarders.

613
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,300
Felt like I was part
of an obstacle course.

614
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,433
Peter, can you see alright?

615
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,767
I don't want you
to miss anything here.

617
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,467
Here we go.

618
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,233
Hey, what are you
doing out of bed?

619
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,300
Looking for the bathroom.

620
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,333
Oh, I'll take you to it.

621
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,533
No, I found it.

622
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,267
Alright, then
I'll take you to your bed.

623
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,533
You're looking better.

624
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,200
Are you feeling better?

625
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,533
Wilson?

626
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,267
What is it,
is something wrong?

627
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,400
I should have
told the policeman.

628
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,333
They're gonna keep
asking me, aren't they?

629
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:39,367
Well, they wanna find out
who did this.

630
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,867
If you remembered
anything

631
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,700
I can go and get
the detective.

632
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,700
No.

633
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:46,600
Wilson, when you came in here

634
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,467
you said there
was a man chasing you.

635
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,800
He was White.

636
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,833
He seemed tall, but I got
on my bike right away.

637
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,100
Did you know this man?

638
00:24:54,133 --> 00:24:55,500
Had you seen him before?

639
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,300
We'd seen him there earlier

640
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,333
and we'd seen him
before in the park

641
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,733
when we'd gone there to play.

642
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:04,767
Uh‐huh, and if you
saw this man again

643
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,500
would you recognize him?

644
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,633
I don't know. Maybe.

645
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,500
Do I have to talk
to the policeman again?

646
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:13,133
When are my mom and dad coming?

647
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:15,167
Don't worry, they'll be here.

648
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,533
'Hey, Carol.'

649
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,433
Cops had to leave.
They'll be back in a little bit.

650
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:20,233
They wanted you to know they've
got your bike at the station.

651
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,667
Oh, thanks, Jeanie.

652
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,700
'You sure it's this room?'

653
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,833
No, but I was
in here earlier.

654
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:27,800
Anyway, I was saying,
it's a randomized

655
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,600
double‐blind
multi‐center study

656
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:32,400
funded by one of those
hoo‐ha biotech companies.

657
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,700
And the drug is for the
treatment of fracture pain?

658
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:37,667
Mm‐hmm. Comparing it against
acetaminophen with codeine.

659
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,400
Hopefully, it will
come up more effective

660
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,433
with fewer side effects.

661
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:44,100
A colleague of mine is
coordinating it from Atlanta.

662
00:25:44,133 --> 00:25:47,300
So you want me to conduct
a study at County General.

663
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,267
Well, I know Kerry's
doing the sternal saw study.

664
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,467
I thought you might
wanna oversee this one..

665
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,767
...if you're game.

666
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,167
I'm game. Why not?

667
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,300
'Hey, doc, need some help?'

668
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,533
Hey, I was just helping Dr. Lee.

669
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:00,700
We're trying to find
her earring.

670
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,767
You know, that's okay.

671
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm gonna check the desk.

672
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:05,400
Thanks, Mark.

673
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,733
Isn't that
a nurse's job?

674
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,800
They were busy
replenishing albuterol

675
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,433
and mixing ipratropium.

676
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:12,700
I was trying to help
in an emergent situation.

677
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:14,200
Who actually injected
the magnesium?

678
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:15,633
I did.

679
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,467
Did you verify the dosage
with nursing staff?

680
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
No.

681
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,533
When did you
realize your mistake?

682
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:23,467
The patient went into
respiratory arrest at 1534

683
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,133
14 minutes into
the magnesium injection.

684
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,233
Continue, Dr. Corday.

685
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,367
Endotracheal
intubation was performed.

686
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,133
Heart rate dropped to 30.

687
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,700
The patient received
IV calcium and atropine.

688
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:39,767
A transvenous pacing wire was
placed, captured at 1556 hrs.

689
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,667
Who was your
supervising resident?

690
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,167
‐ Dr. Benton.
‐ Who left you unsupervised.

691
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,733
Within minutes,
she had the patient intubated

692
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,533
and on a transvenous pacemaker.

693
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,467
Because of her quick response
the patient recovered fully

694
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,200
with no cardiac, respiratory,
or neurological sequelae.

695
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,867
I think it's important that we
look at the outcome here.

696
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,433
Thank you, Dr. Benton,
but I'm not looking to you

697
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,500
for defense of my actions.

698
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:04,867
In fact, I feel that M&M has
become a forum

699
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,800
to place blame,
cover up mistakes

700
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:12,267
or be grateful
that there's not a lawsuit.

701
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,633
I would argue that actually
we should embrace our mistakes

702
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,167
and learn from them
to improve the system.

703
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
I believe I made this mistake

704
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,433
not because I was
untrained or incompetent

705
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:27,567
but because I was exhausted,
having been up for 36 hours.

706
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,867
If we really want
to‐to cut down on our errors

707
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,533
why don't we, for example,
allow on‐call house officers

708
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:37,767
to leave by 12:00 noon
on the post‐call day?

709
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,167
Why don't we establish
a night float system?

710
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,567
Air traffic controllers
work with aeroplanes

711
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,367
four to six hours a day.

712
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,600
no more than two
hours without a break.

713
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,867
Now, why?

714
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,100
Because human life is at stake.

715
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:52,867
Yet we allow surgical interns

716
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,500
to work 36 hours
without sleep.

717
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,700
Why?

718
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:00,133
'Because we've
all had to do it?'

719
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:03,333
'Because the surgeons
before us have had to do it?'

720
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,600
'Well, old school tradition
may be wonderfully nostalgic'

721
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:09,633
but it is clearly not in the
best interest of our patients.

722
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,433
Now, if you disagree with me

723
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:14,467
why don't you ask
yourself next time you fly.

724
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,167
Do you really want
that man in the control room

725
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,767
to be on his 36th hour?

726
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,767
She's full of piss
and vinegar, isn't she?

727
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,133
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ For an old lady.

728
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,367
Because she's an old lady.

729
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,167
Alright, everybody
look at the camera lens.

730
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,667
If you're looking
at the camera lens

731
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,833
you're in the picture.

732
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,400
Okay, and smile.

733
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,100
'Okay, I just need, uh'

734
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,800
'Mrs. Johnson's children
inside, okay?'

735
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,067
'For a quick picture.'

736
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:46,767
She's done it again.

737
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:50,267
Mrs. Johnson?

738
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,767
Mrs. Johnson,
you playing possum again?

739
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,067
Come on, Ruth.
Time to wake up now.

740
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,400
Ruth?

741
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:05,833
Mrs. Johnson?

742
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh, God. Kate, go get
a gurney and a crash cart now.

743
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:15,267
I‐I don't want to bother you

744
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,733
but the boys' clothes
are all mixed up.

745
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,567
Andy's.. His boots are missing.

746
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,167
And‐and I've got
Wilson's sneakers.

747
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,733
Oh, I am so sorry.

748
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:26,400
If you'll just have a seat, I'm
gonna go check for you, okay?

749
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,167
Connie, have you seen
Wilson's belongings bag?

750
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,533
Maybe check under
the trauma gurney.

751
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:24,533
Hey, Connie, I need
to talk to Wilson.

752
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,633
Could you give us a minute?

753
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,433
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

754
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,567
Wilson, wake up.

755
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,833
Hey, Wilson.

756
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,267
‐ Are my parents here?
‐ Nope, not yet.

757
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,267
But I got to thinking and, uh..

758
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,867
...Andy was probably
your best friend, right?

759
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,333
Sometimes.

760
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,300
Whenever your parents would
go out of town on business

761
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,167
you'd stay over there?

762
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,333
It's closer to school.

763
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,700
We could ride our bikes.

764
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:59,800
So you probably..

765
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,400
...shared each other's toys?

766
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:04,833
Maybe even coats..

767
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
...gloves, boots?

768
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,367
Andy would never
let me wear his boots.

769
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,433
‐ Kind of too small, anyway.
‐ Oh.

770
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,600
Remember when you were
trying to take them off?

771
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,600
Right.

772
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,233
So if he never
let you wear his boots

773
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,167
then how come
you were wearing them

774
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,767
when the paramedics
brought you in here?

775
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:28,200
'Cause we had a bet and I won.

776
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,800
A bet?

777
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,300
To see who
could ride faster

778
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,600
from his house
to the park, and I won.

779
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:36,833
And whoever won
got to wear the boots, right?

780
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:39,733
Yeah, but he
wouldn't give them to me.

781
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,667
I rode faster
and he knew it.

782
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,300
He wasn't being fair.

783
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,267
Are these yours or Andy's?

784
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,300
Neither.
They're my dad's.

785
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,100
Wilson, did you
put these into a gun?

786
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,667
No. Those are extras.

787
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,533
I already
had some in the gun.

788
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,167
And when Andy
didn't give you the boots..

789
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,300
...you pointed the gun at him?

790
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,600
And you shot him?

791
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,867
Not to hurt him or anything.

792
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,133
Just to scare him.

793
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:22,367
We had a bet and I won,
it was fair and square.

794
00:32:25,233 --> 00:32:29,500
You do know,
that you hurt him now, right?

795
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,533
Look, all I meant
was to get the boots.

796
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,300
You can't go back
on a bet, that's not right.

797
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,367
Andy knows that.

798
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,233
What did you do
with the gun, Wilson?

799
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:42,267
I dropped it down a drainpipe
when I got on my bike.

800
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,700
See, the thing is,
none of this would have happened

801
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,400
if that car hadn't hit me.

802
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,500
You'll let me know
when my parents get here, right?

803
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,733
Yeah, Wilson, I'll let you know.

804
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:01,767
Oh, Nurse Hathaway?

805
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,233
Can you please not tell
my dad I threw his gun away.

806
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:06,367
He'll get really mad.

807
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:15,867
So you're actually telling me
that he could go home today.

808
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,333
Yeah, we don't have
prisons for eight‐year‐olds.

809
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,500
I'm not talking
prison, I'm talking

810
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,167
juvenile hall, detention center.

811
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,333
Not for kids under ten.

812
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,767
Can an eight‐year‐old
even understand his rights?

813
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,367
Or the consequences
of his actions?

814
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,667
Well, of course he can.

815
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,667
He shot Andy so he could
get the boots, right?

816
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,367
He wanted to scare the boy.

817
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,167
His intent might have been
just that, not to kill.

818
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,133
But he did kill him!

819
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,233
I mean doesn't that
count for something?

820
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:37,267
Yeah, but what?

821
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,867
Murder two, manslaughter?

822
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,300
The kid is eight years old.

823
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,367
Isn't it up to
the state attorney?

824
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,233
Yes, but he's
got to be assessed

825
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,733
he has to have
a psych evaluation.

826
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:47,567
And social services
has to determine

827
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,633
whether he can differentiate
between right and wrong.

828
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:50,867
Of course he can.

829
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,100
Why would he make up a story

830
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,500
about the man chasing them?

831
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,833
Does he have any awareness
of what he's done?

832
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,333
Has he shown any remorse?

833
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:59,333
Yeah, he's sorry
he tossed the gun.

834
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,600
Afraid his father's
gonna get mad at him.

835
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:03,467
Does that count as remorse?

836
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,433
You are telling me the police,
the courts, psych

837
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:11,267
social services, nobody knows
what to do with Wilson Geary?

838
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,133
Pretty much.

839
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,300
What a mess.

840
00:34:16,867 --> 00:34:18,300
Anything else
you want me to do?

841
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,700
Not right now.

842
00:34:19,733 --> 00:34:20,767
I'll put her things in here.

843
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,733
Thanks, Chuny.

844
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,167
I'll go talk to the family.

845
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:36,567
Apparently, she was
sucking on a hard candy

846
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,433
and it lodged in her windpipe.

847
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:39,767
We were able to extract it

848
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,567
and her BP is now 128/90.

849
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,867
Heart rate's 70.
Vital signs all appear normal.

850
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,200
‐ You mean she's not dead?
‐ No, no. She's not dead.

851
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:51,267
She's asleep,
but definitely not dead.

852
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,533
Can we see her?

853
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,233
Like I said,
she's asleep, so..

854
00:34:57,633 --> 00:35:00,333
Dr. Lee?
I'm really sorry.

855
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:02,267
We looked everywhere and we
couldn't find your earring.

856
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,200
Oh. Well, thank you
anyway for looking.

857
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,567
Did you lose an earring?

858
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,867
Yes. Not expensive or anything.

859
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,600
‐ Sentimental value.
‐ Oh?

860
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:15,300
‐ Yes, I was engaged once.
‐ Hmm.

861
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,700
To a really lovely
man, and he was killed

862
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:22,300
in a freak horseback
riding accident.

863
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,800
Actually, we were on a bridge,
and the horse spooked and..

864
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,733
‐ Oh.
‐ Anyway, he gave them to me.

865
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:32,400
I'm so sorry.

866
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:34,233
It was a long time ago.

867
00:36:00,467 --> 00:36:03,133
Yeah. David Kotlowitz, please.

868
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,200
Peter Benton.

869
00:36:04,233 --> 00:36:05,300
Hey, David. Hey.

870
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,833
Uh, listen, I, um..

871
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:11,333
I wanted to postpone
Reese's operation.

872
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:14,300
Well, I mean, you know, he's
barely within the age range

873
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,367
and he's got a fair
amount of residual hearing

874
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,733
and the technology's
changing all the time.

875
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,767
I just, you know..

876
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,433
No, yeah. I‐I just saw him.

877
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:23,733
He's.. He's doing fine.

878
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,633
Mm‐hmm.

879
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,833
Yeah, well, uh, you, too.

880
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,367
Have a great holiday, alright?

881
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,467
My parents called on
the way from the airport.

882
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,167
My dad has a phone in his car.

883
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,700
You're mad at me about
something, aren't you?

884
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,833
No.

885
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,433
When my mom gets
mad she just stands

886
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:53,333
at the kitchen
sink and does dishes

887
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:56,300
and she doesn't say anything.

888
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,733
I'm not mad, Wilson.

889
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:00,733
I'm sad about
what happened to Andy.

890
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,500
I mean it's so cool if he was
in one of these other beds.

891
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,500
Do you know what
it means to be sad?

892
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:12,833
Wilson, do you
know what it means

893
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,733
to have done something wrong?

894
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,700
Carol, his parents are here.

895
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,667
Thanks, Connie.

896
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,800
What, you waiting on a bus?

897
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,333
I wish I was on
a bus going anywhere.

898
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:56,233
Oh. How'd it go
with Anspaugh?

899
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,733
Ah, well,
no crime, no punishment.

900
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,467
Seems what I did
wasn't terribly wrong

901
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,167
therefore no need
to penalize me

902
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,633
therefore no need
to examine a system

903
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,400
that has served so many
so well for so long.

904
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:08,400
Yeah, they seemed
pretty shocked

905
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:09,700
that you actually suggested it.

906
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,700
As were you.

907
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:16,367
Yeah, well, it wouldn't
have been my choice.

908
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,367
Well, you and I never make
the same choices, do we?

909
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,767
No.

910
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:31,400
Well, Peter, we could now.

911
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,700
Come on, Peter.
This should be over.

912
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:35,500
I mean some would
argue that it already is.

913
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,733
We haven't been alone
together for weeks.

914
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:42,133
I need to focus
on my son right now.

915
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,100
Look we could both draw up
a list of reasons why

916
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:48,533
but why don't we just put it
down to faulty construction?

917
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:52,833
A casual relationship has to
grow into something or it dies.

918
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,700
Well, it's not like I
haven't wanted to see it grow.

919
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:57,700
It's just that I..

920
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:00,733
...I don't have it
to give right now. I..

921
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,233
Yeah.

922
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,800
I understand that.

923
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,067
Which is why I think
maybe, um..

924
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,133
...we'll be better
off as friends.

925
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,733
‐ I'll see you around, okay?
‐ Okay.

926
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,100
Now, you probably
didn't know it

927
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,300
but we've been
off work for 20 minutes.

928
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,467
Get something to eat?

929
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,333
Maybe Rosebud
or Morton's, Johnny D's?

930
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,500
Home, bathtub, bed.

931
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,667
That's my girl.

932
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,100
I met them today, you know.

933
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:41,200
Seemed like
perfectly normal people.

934
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:43,367
Father's a sales rep,
office supplies.

935
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,733
Mother went to
Dallas with him

936
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,833
'cause she wanted to
visit her favorite aunt.

937
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,667
Wilson's parents?

938
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,200
Thought they'd
have to be monsters

939
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,267
to raise a kid who could
do something like that.

940
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,433
Well, that would explain
everything, wouldn't it?

941
00:39:54,467 --> 00:39:57,700
Parents beat the kid,
or they yell at him

942
00:39:57,733 --> 00:40:00,300
or starve him so he ends up
killing his best friend.

943
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,867
Then why did he do it?

944
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,267
Stuff happens.

945
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,867
An eight‐year‐old shoots
another eight‐year‐old

946
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,633
and you say stuff happens?

947
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,433
You got a better answer?

948
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:16,533
No. No, I don't.
I don't know.

949
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:19,533
Maybe his genes
are screwy or..

950
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:21,767
...his parents seem nice, but
they ignore him. I don't know.

951
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,267
Maybe he plays
too many video games

952
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,267
like every kid in America.
It's..

953
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,233
Doesn't it bother you
that there isn't any reason?

954
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:34,367
No, it bothers me
that you cared about him

955
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,333
and you believed in him,
and now you feel betrayed.

956
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:39,467
I don't feel betrayed.

957
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,067
I feel...scared.

958
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,367
I mean, if you don't
know what causes it

959
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,100
how do you keep
it from happening?

960
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:49,833
Are we any different
from that couple?

961
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,633
They didn't see it coming.
Would we see it coming?

962
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:56,433
Yeah, you bring a child
into this world

963
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:57,533
and you think that
they're helpless

964
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:00,667
but actually,
I think it's us.

965
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,867
I think we're the ones
that are helpless.

966
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,100
We probably are but..

967
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:06,700
And that's why you
love them as much as you can

968
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,567
and you teach
them as best you can

969
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:14,100
and then you
wish them good luck.

970
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,666
What do you say?

971
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:25,866
Home, bath, bed?

972
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,233
Hmm?

973
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:35,699
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

974
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:42,782
I mean you know
if you don't have any plans

975
00:41:42,816 --> 00:41:44,416
if you're not busy.

976
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,649
Having a drink sounds great.
Can we also eat something?

977
00:41:46,682 --> 00:41:48,082
‐ Dinner, absolutely.
‐ Okay.

978
00:41:48,116 --> 00:41:49,216
I have a meeting
with Anspaugh

979
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,582
for about 20
then I'll be right back.

980
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:52,049
‐ Sounds great.
‐ Buddy, we're going home.

981
00:41:52,082 --> 00:41:53,082
What's your story?

982
00:41:53,116 --> 00:41:54,249
Ah, catching up on paperwork.

983
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:55,616
Well, curfew's at 11:00.

984
00:41:55,649 --> 00:41:57,082
Ha, ha, ha.
Very funny.

985
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
ER.

986
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:07,073
How about this snow?

987
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:08,273
Yeah, it's pretty great, huh?

988
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:09,973
‐ Have a good shift.
‐ 'Always.'

989
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:11,340
Whoa, you got to help me.
My wife's having a baby!

990
00:42:11,373 --> 00:42:13,073
What?

991
00:42:13,106 --> 00:42:14,073
Huh?

992
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:17,406
Hang on, hang on.

993
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,106
We're not due
for two more weeks.

994
00:42:20,173 --> 00:42:21,373
Somebody lied.

995
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:23,040
Oh, God, Louis,
help me. Help me!

996
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,373
We're gonna help you.
We're gonna help you.

997
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:26,140
‐ Okay, get Mark and a gurney.
‐ Yeah.

998
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:27,973
‐ Do something, please.
‐ Ma'am, ma'am, I'm a doctor.

999
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:34,806
Alright, alright, I got it.

1000
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,706
Bring her up.

1001
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,206
Good. You know how to breathe.

1002
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,273
‐ This is our fourth.
‐ Then I guess it's coming.

1003
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:43,140
‐ When did it start snowing?
‐ Crowning.

1004
00:42:43,173 --> 00:42:44,773
We're not due
for two more weeks.

1005
00:42:44,806 --> 00:42:46,806
‐ It must be all the excitement.
‐ What's your name?

1006
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm Louis, Louis Bernucci.
This is my wife Gilda.

1007
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:51,006
Hi, Gilda, nice to meet you.
You ready to push?

1008
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,006
On the next one,
I want you to push, okay?

1009
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,373
Ready, and one, two, three.
Push!

1010
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,173
God!

1011
00:43:00,173 --> 00:43:03,173
If it's a girl,
I wanna name it after nana.

1012
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,973
Ruth?

1013
00:43:05,006 --> 00:43:06,206
Ruth Johnson.

1014
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,973
Ruth Johnson Bernucci.

1015
00:43:08,006 --> 00:43:09,040
'What do you think?'

1016
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,073
Oh, it sounds good to me.

1017
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:11,273
‐ 'Yeah?'
‐ 'Yeah.'

1018
00:43:11,306 --> 00:43:13,940
Yeah? Okay, Gilda, I like that.

1019
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:15,373
Hang in there.
You're doing great.

1020
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,106
Good. This one, push.
This is it.

1021
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,973
Push! Push, push, push.

1022
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:20,206
God!

1023
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,040
Okay, the head's clear.
Shoulders.

1024
00:43:24,073 --> 00:43:26,040
There we go.

1025
00:43:26,073 --> 00:43:29,106
A beautiful baby girl.

1026
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,873
Okay, good,
let's wrap her.

1027
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:33,173
Get the suction.

1028
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:34,173
Okay.

1029
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,906
Okay, there's your mama.

1030
00:43:41,806 --> 00:43:43,306
There's your mom.

1031
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,940
There's your mama.

1032
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,240
Okay, clamp.

1033
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:53,840
Excellent.

1034
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:56,440
Okay. Okay, alright, mom.

1035
00:43:56,473 --> 00:43:57,706
We're just gonna
take her over here.

1036
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,040
'Just a minute.'

1037
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:01,340
'Coming right back to mom.'

1038
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:04,740
Oh!

1039
00:44:04,773 --> 00:44:05,840
'Good job.'

1040
00:44:11,806 --> 00:44:13,906
Shh, shh, shh.

1041
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:16,806
Hello.

1042
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:21,306
