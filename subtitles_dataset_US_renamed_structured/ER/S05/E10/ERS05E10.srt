1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,666
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,166
We'd be better
off as friends.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,233
Mark, thanks again
for dinner last night.

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,433
God forbid you should listen
to me and learn something!

5
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:17,733
‐ Yes, I was engaged once.
‐ Hmm.

6
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:21,400
To a really lovely man
and he was killed in a..

7
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:23,366
...freak horseback
riding accident.

8
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,266
Shh, shh, shh.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,333
'You know you bring a child
into this world'

10
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,466
and you think that
they're helpless

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
but actually,
I think it's us.

12
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:35,633
I think we're the ones
that are helpless.

13
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,333
'Hey, Carol, what time's
that big do at your mom's?'

14
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,500
'Right after church.'

15
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,800
I promised her
we'd be there

16
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,500
for Christmas caroling
with Uncle Ted.

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,033
That the old guy
with the banjo?

18
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:51,733
It's a family tradition.

19
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:54,400
You know, kind of like
going to mass on Christmas Eve.

20
00:00:54,433 --> 00:00:56,733
Nah, I told you, if I go,
I feel like a hypocrite.

21
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,300
All that kneeling
and standing‐‐

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,733
‐ You could just sit there.
‐ Yeah, yeah.

23
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,033
Everybody looks
at me with the dirty looks.

24
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:03,166
Like I'm a pagan.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,266
You are a pagan.

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,066
Oh, what a glorious day.

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,433
Did you see the sky?

28
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:09,700
Oh, yeah,
it's like a painting.

29
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,433
Makes you glad
to be alive.

30
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:12,633
Unless you're being persecuted.

31
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,700
Persecuted?

32
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,100
He's upset about Dr. Lee's

33
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,133
new charting system.

34
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,400
What new charting system?

35
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,500
Each patient
gets two charts.

36
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,333
One for the doc,
one for the nurse.

37
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,533
That way we get to do our notes
the same time you guys do.

38
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:25,100
Orders get in quicker,
patients get meds faster.

39
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,500
Oh. Docs don't waste time
chasing down charts.

40
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:29,133
So what's the problem?

41
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,733
The problem is
that someone

42
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,100
has to keep track of twice
as many charts as normal

43
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,700
thereby doubling his workload,
not that anyone cares.

44
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:37,233
Good morning, gang.

45
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,500
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Oh.

46
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,300
Amanda, what have you done?

47
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,100
Assorted Christmas nibblies..

48
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:44,233
...some dried fruit, mixed nuts,
some little chocolate reindeer.

49
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,766
‐ Oh, don't mind if I do.
‐ Oh, oh.

50
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,733
Just wait.
First dibs go to Jerry.

51
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:50,400
I think it's only fair,
since he's the one

52
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:52,433
bearing the brunt
of the new charting system.

53
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,366
No. No, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

54
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
Oh? Well, as you wish.

55
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,266
But seriously, Jerry

56
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,233
if you find yourself
in the weeds, call me.

57
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:00,566
I'll make sure you get
the support you need.

58
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,633
‐ Alright?
‐ Sure.

59
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,433
Excuse me.

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,133
That's a Christmas
card image.

61
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,166
‐ Hey.
‐ Surgeon wrapping a book.

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,466
What is it,
something educational

63
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,766
for one of your nieces?

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,066
No, actually, it's for you.

65
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
It's T. S. Eliot.

66
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,466
You know, you said
you liked him, so I, uh..

67
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,366
...got it last month
when we were still, you know..

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Peter, that's so sweet.

69
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah.

70
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,666
Um, I can't think
of a more thoughtful gift.

71
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,366
Thank you.

72
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, please. Forget it.

73
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,033
Listen, um,
I was wondering

74
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,766
if we could, uh, finish
our work‐ups around noon.

75
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,266
'I, uh, I need to get out
of here early tonight.'

76
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,533
Have you got big
Christmas Eve plans?

77
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,666
Yeah. My sister's
hosting a dinner.

78
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,200
Carla's gonna bring Reese by.

79
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,300
I haven't seen him all week.

80
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,266
Oh, don't worry.
I understand.

81
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,466
I absolutely hate being

82
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,133
away from my family
during the holidays.

83
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,100
In fact, I'm so desperate

84
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,800
not to be alone
this Christmas Eve

85
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:05,766
that I...I bought a ticket to
the surgeon society gala.

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,166
Oh, golly.

87
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,500
Yep. And you won't believe
who's sitting next to me.

88
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:14,800
Hey! There she is.
So I checked around.

89
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,633
We definitely have
the coolest table

90
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,400
and, uh, it's
really kinda lucky

91
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,300
that we were both able
to make it tonight, huh?

92
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,466
A little trouble
in paradise, huh?

93
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,733
Anyway, so, um, tonight's
dinner is semiformal

94
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:29,333
so any slinky
black number will do

95
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,433
although, if I may voice
a personal preference

96
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:34,066
something short and off
the shoulder would be ideal.

97
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,766
Peter, by the way,
that reminds me.

98
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
I have about a week's worth
of charts to review

99
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,100
and I'm really trying
to get outta here early

100
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,700
so I need you to cover
my teaching rounds.

101
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,366
Whoa, whoa. That's gonna
mess up my morning.

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,566
Well, look at it this way,
I get to have a life

103
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,100
and you get to earn
a special place in my heart.

104
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,366
Jerry, do you know
a garage that's open?

105
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,700
My piece of crap car
died on the Dan Ryan.

106
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:48,166
On Christmas Eve?
Good luck.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
Lydia, is that, uh..

108
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,500
Christmas card from Jen.

109
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,600
My ex‐wife sent you
a Christmas card?

110
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,800
‐ No, she sent one to me.
‐ You?

111
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,033
Yeah, Jen and I have exchanged
cards for years.

112
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,266
Christmas, birthdays.

113
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,100
I was just reading
the newsletter.

114
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,133
Merry Christmas from the Simons.

115
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,500
What?

116
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,733
That new house they bought
sounds amazing.

117
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:05,600
I know.
5,000 square feet.

118
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,466
Six bedrooms, three baths.

119
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Yeah, sounds just like Jen
to be bragging about her house.

120
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,600
Yeah. I wouldn't call it
bragging exactly.

121
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:13,733
More like
sharing good news.

122
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,033
Yeah, Jen made partner.

123
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,366
Partner? Jen made partner?

124
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,266
The firm even
bought her a new Beemer.

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,066
I love those convertibles.

126
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,133
Oh, you know what?

127
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,066
Mack's Garage on Wacker is open.

128
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,533
They'll tow your
piece of crap car.

129
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:27,266
Thanks, Jerry.

130
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,666
"Dear Dr. Carter, I'm sure
you don't remember me

131
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,166
"but I wouldn't be around this
Christmas if it weren't for you.

132
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,633
"You're a lifesaver,
the Lord's instrument on Earth."

133
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,100
Pacer pads?

134
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,366
Third drawer on the left.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,800
"May God bless you and keep you.

136
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,466
Merry Christmas,
Emily Ropella."

137
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,566
Do you remember her?

138
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,766
Not a clue.

139
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,633
That's a nice card though.

140
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,166
Does it bother you that the Lord
gets all the credit?

141
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,700
One can be called worse things
than an instrument of God.

142
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:59,133
So you believe in..

143
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,400
I give him the
benefit of the doubt.

144
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:03,233
‐ You?
‐ I don't know.

145
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,600
Sometimes I can't help
but think

146
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,366
that God is just
this comforting illusion.

147
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,800
We all want everything
to mean something

148
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:11,633
so we create this all‐knowing
puppet master in the sky

149
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,433
when really everything
is just arbitrary

150
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,466
in life, death,
natural disasters..

151
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,400
Oh!

152
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,500
Ow.

153
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,166
The master is displeased.

154
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,133
I'm so sorry, Peter. I can't
believe he foisted this on you.

155
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:26,133
Ah, there's no use
in worrying about it now.

156
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,466
Well, look,
I'll start on the pre‐ops.

157
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,566
That should save
you some time I guess.

158
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,766
Whatever.

159
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,566
Hello, Mr. Gardner.

160
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,300
I have the results
of your MRI.

161
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,433
Great. So how's it look?

162
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,600
Good news.

163
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,100
It appears the cancer

164
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,733
hasn't spread
beyond the capsule.

165
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:48,066
Great. So, uh, does this mean
I can hold onto my prostate?

166
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,366
Well, I'm afraid not.

167
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,033
Dr. Romano does
want to continue

168
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:52,400
with the radical
prostatectomy

169
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:55,033
tomorrow morning
as scheduled.

170
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,200
But with the surgery

171
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,466
you stand an
excellent chance

172
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,100
of beating the cancer.

173
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,466
It really is
very good news.

174
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,466
Is, uh...is Dr. Romano around?

175
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,266
He's in surgery.

176
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,500
Is it something
I can help you with?

177
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,433
Well, he had mentioned
uh, that the operation

178
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,366
could result in
my losing sexual function.

179
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I take it that's
still the case.

180
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,366
Well, we'll try our best to do
a nerve‐sparing procedure

181
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
but there is that
possibility, yes.

182
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,466
How strong a possibility?

183
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,466
Well, according to
Dr. Romano's notes

184
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,533
as high as 75% to 80%.

185
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:32,233
80%.

186
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:39,300
Has Dr. Romano
discussed your options

187
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,633
about having children
in the future?

188
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,200
Uh, no.

189
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:45,666
Well, you might
want to consider

190
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,233
paying a visit
to a sperm bank.

191
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:50,033
That way, if there
is a loss of function

192
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,800
you'll still be able
to father children

193
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,800
through alternative means.

194
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,000
Right.

195
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,366
Dr. Lee.

196
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,633
‐ You startled me.
‐ Uh, sorry.

197
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,400
Dr. Anspaugh would like
you to call him.

198
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,633
Is there something wrong
with Dr. Greene's locker?

199
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,600
Well, I found it ajar,
so I thought I'd better shut it

200
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,200
before something walked away.

201
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,266
'Thanks for the message.'

202
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,666
Sure.

203
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,100
I've got super ventricular
tachycardia.

204
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:16,533
It happens all the time.

205
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,133
Rate's 160. BP's 100 palp.

206
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,200
Just cardiovert me at 50
and I'm on my way.

207
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,533
Alright, let's put him
on a monitor

208
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,600
and get a strip.

209
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm...trying to tell you

210
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,333
I got SVTs.

211
00:08:27,366 --> 00:08:30,300
Uh, just cardiovert me at 50.

212
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,433
It works every time.

213
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:33,433
Okay, I appreciate
the tip

214
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:34,733
but I need
to examine you myself.

215
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm just trying
to save some time here.

216
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,800
Uh‐huh. You stop talking.

217
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,766
Would you tell him
that I have SVTs?

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,466
I've got SVTs!

219
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,333
‐ Ah, let go.
‐ I got SVTs.

220
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:46,533
I heard you!
I need to examine you myself.

221
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:47,566
I'm going to be
late for work.

222
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,066
Let go.

223
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,266
Are you, uh, one of
Santa's helpers?

224
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Argh. The helpers just
pass out the goody bags.

225
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm an elf, a singing elf.

226
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:59,266
‐ You're part of a choir?
‐ There's four of us.

227
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,166
But thanks to
super doc here

228
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,300
it looks like the elf tones
are going to be a tenor short.

229
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,166
‐ Here you go, Dr. Greene.
‐ Says I've got SVTs, right?

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,666
I knew it!

231
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,633
You want to shock me
at 50 now, smart ass?

232
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,700
Got an 18‐year‐old kid
flatline.

233
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,200
Alright.
How long down?

234
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,400
Unknown. Mother
found him in his room.

235
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,600
We've been working
on him for 15.

236
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,166
Gave him two rounds epi,
two of atropine.

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
Any signs of life?

238
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,666
Got him back once,
then we lost him again.

239
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,233
Alright. Let's get him
on a monitor.

240
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:22,533
Carter, you might
check ventilation.

241
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,433
‐ What can I do?
‐ Rectal temp.

242
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,566
Great.

243
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
Alright, on my count.

244
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,633
Watch your hand, there.

245
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:32,366
One, two, three, go.

246
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Alright, any signs
of drugs, suicide?

247
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,766
No. He told his mom
he had a killer headache

248
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,533
went for a nap,
never woke up.

249
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:39,200
Sounds like
a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

250
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,366
Killer headache
is right.

251
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,566
Monitor's up.

252
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,566
‐ No femoral pulse.
‐ Asystole.

253
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
No spontaneous
respirations.

254
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,066
No response to pain.

255
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,700
Anybody got any good news?

256
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:51,800
Pupils are..

257
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,400
...fixed and dilated.

258
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:54,433
No corneal reflex.

259
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:56,166
He's only 18.

260
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,566
Alright. Well, Zadro
got him back once.

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Maybe we can do it again.

262
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,266
Start with a high dose epi

263
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,600
put him on a pulse ox

264
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,633
an end title CO2 detector.

265
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,166
‐ Paddles, please.
‐ Alright, crank it to 50.

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
‐ Let's go.
‐ Let's start at 20.

267
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,566
20? Why?

268
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,666
Why? Because I said so,
that's why.

269
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,033
Oh, that's mature.

270
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:17,500
Charged to 20. Clear.

271
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,666
‐ How'd we do?
‐ No change.

272
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,333
Uh, 50.
Do I hear 50?

273
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,500
Okay, let's go to 30.

274
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,733
Oh, for crying out loud.

275
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,433
Mark, why not
just go to 50?

276
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,100
Because he has
a sensitive rhythm

277
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,333
I don't wanna
overshock him.

278
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:32,300
‐ Alright, charged to 30.
‐ Clear.

279
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,566
‐ Anything?
‐ Nothing.

280
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,200
Uh, you know,
I don't want to question

281
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:41,066
your medical genius, doc,
but can we go to 50

282
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,533
while I've still got
some hair on my chest?

283
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,666
‐ Let's go to 50.
‐ It's about time.

284
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
‐ Charged.
‐ Clear.

285
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,033
That did it.

286
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,466
Back to normal sinus.

287
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,666
Watch him for 15
and then let him go.

288
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,566
Thanks for nothing,
Dr. Mengele!

289
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,466
Time?

290
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,666
12 minutes.

291
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,433
Alright, let's
check his rhythm.

292
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,133
Still no pulse.
Asystole.

293
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,200
‐ Keep at it.
‐ Ten of epi on board.

294
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,700
Dr. Ross, the boy's
mother is out in chairs.

295
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,166
She'd like to
talk to someone.

296
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,266
Alright. Carter,
you want to do that?

297
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,466
Don't get her hopes up.

298
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,033
Alright, give me another epi,
seven milligrams.

299
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,600
Mrs. Richards.

300
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:23,633
My son?

301
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,233
Hi, I'm Doctor Carter.

302
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,100
Your son's heart
stopped beating

303
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,666
and we are doing everything that
we can to get it started again.

304
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,400
We are giving him medicine,
and we are doing CPR.

305
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:33,766
Why would his heart stop?

306
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,633
He's 18‐years‐old.

307
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,233
There's a sign that he
had a brain hemorrhage

308
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,566
which could have caused
the cardiac arrest.

309
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
How?

310
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:44,733
He's the picture of health.

311
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,400
It could be
a weak artery.

312
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,700
Possibly something
that's been there since birth.

313
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,733
The thing is,
he's been down a long time..

314
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:53,800
...and the longer that
he goes without oxygen

315
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,133
the less likely it is

316
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,766
that we can
bring him back.

317
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,633
And you and I might need
to have conversation‐‐

318
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,466
Please, don't give up on him.

319
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,566
He's all that I have.

320
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,000
Please.

321
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,333
Okay.

322
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:11,733
I'll be back.

323
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:17,466
Alright, hold it,
hold the compression.

324
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,366
‐ Any sign of a rhythm?
‐ Flatline.

325
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,533
Alright. Let's call it.

326
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,766
Not yet. Keep bagging.

327
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,366
You got some reason
to keep flogging this kid?

328
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,766
Yeah, he's 18..

329
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,566
...he's his mother's only child,
and it's Christmas.

330
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
You're looking for a miracle?
He's been down for 40 minutes.

331
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,066
So what's five more?

332
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
Okay, doctor, let's go.

333
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm resuming chest compressions.
Let's keep bagging.

334
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,066
Let's give another round
of high‐dose epi.

335
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,566
Start a dopamine drip wide open.
Get those paddles ready.

336
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Paddles won't work,
he's in Asystole.

337
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:43,800
He could be in fine V‐fib.
Charge to 300.

338
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,166
‐ No, no, no. 360.
‐ 'Charging.'

339
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,500
Alright, everybody let's hold

340
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,266
a really, really
positive thought.

341
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,500
‐ Ready.
‐ Clear.

342
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,066
‐ Was that a beat?
‐ 'Oh, my God.'

343
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,466
A few agonal beats
does not a rhythm make.

344
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,433
Let's slap some pacer pads
on him right now.

345
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,700
Alright, here you go.

346
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,200
Can you roll him?

347
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,666
‐ Set it at 80.
‐ You're on.

348
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
It's not capturing.

349
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,566
Dial up the gain.

350
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,533
Come on, we just got
to get it to capture.

351
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:14,566
He's throwing PVCs.

352
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,266
No, hold that Lidocaine.

353
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,433
Maximum gain.

354
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:21,600
Come on. Come on.

355
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:23,466
‐ We got it.
‐ 'He's got a rhythm!'

356
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
'Take a carotid.'

357
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,166
‐ 'Pulse?'
‐ Strong at 120.

358
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,133
‐ BP is 100.
‐ Okay. Let's send him to CT.

359
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,600
Find out where this
bleeding is coming from.

360
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,466
‐ How did you do this?
‐ I am but an instrument‐‐

361
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
‐ Way to go, Carter.
‐ Yeah, nice save.

362
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,733
Hope he's got some brain left.

363
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:36,666
‐ Do you want contrast?
‐ No, but call respiratory.

364
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,533
Make sure they got
a vent in the scanner.

365
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,466
Well, it looks like
we got our miracle.

366
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,233
If he wakes up..

367
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:47,200
...even if he does, he'll
probably have brain damage.

368
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,066
Carter..

369
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,500
...you'd better
prepare the mother.

370
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,680
Yes, ma.
Of course we're coming.

371
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:08,714
Uncle Ted wants Doug
to play "Silent Night"

372
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,180
on the tambourine?

373
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,747
‐ I think he'd love it.
‐ Hmm.

374
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,147
Yeah.

375
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,714
Hey, do you have any,
uh, videotape

376
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:17,714
left in the video cam?

377
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,114
Yeah. Yes, I am coming to mass.
Nope, he's not.

378
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:22,614
But, um, you know what?

379
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,580
We should probably
respect his choice.

380
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,814
It would be lovely if we could
all go together, I know.

381
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,880
Jerry, if anybody needs me,
I'll be out at the roach coach.

382
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:33,180
Okay. I'll be here suffocating
under a mountain of charts.

383
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:37,247
That's odd. I could swear
I had my gloves in my pocket.

384
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,747
Dr. Lee took 'em.

385
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,714
What'd you say?

386
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,914
I saw her
at your locker earlier.

387
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:44,180
That is ridiculous,
Jerry.

388
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:45,747
What's ridiculous?

389
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,247
Jerry's accusing Amanda
of stealing my gloves.

390
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,914
I'm telling you,
she had your locker open

391
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,880
and she was
very suspicious.

392
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,580
Hey, Jerry, I know you're angry

393
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:55,580
at Amanda for
the new chart system

394
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:57,614
but to accuse her
of being a thief..

395
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,780
No, you didn't see
how weird she was acting.

396
00:15:00,814 --> 00:15:02,780
Can it, Jerry.

397
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:05,247
Peter, I finished the work
on Landis. How are you doing?

398
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,880
Two more pre‐ops,
then on to post‐ops.

399
00:15:06,914 --> 00:15:08,680
So you may make
your dinner after all.

400
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,714
‐ Yeah.
‐ Lizzie.

401
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:11,247
What'll it be..

402
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,280
...goose in chestnut sauce
or roast loin of venison?

403
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,914
We gotta call in
our entrees.

404
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,814
Dr. Romano, Mr. Demisa's
coming back in

405
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:18,214
with postoperative pain.

406
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:19,247
Demisa?

407
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,880
Oh, what a pain in the ass.

408
00:15:20,914 --> 00:15:22,214
Oh, Peter, you,
uh, you assisted

409
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:23,614
on his gastroplasty,
didn't you?

410
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,880
‐ What? Uh, yeah.
‐ Great.

411
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,680
When he comes in,
you take him.

412
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,847
Uh, Dr. Romano, I'm already
piled up with work here.

413
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,847
I'm trying to make it home
to my family for dinner.

414
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,147
What can I say, Peter?

415
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,747
Sometimes being
a resident just sucks.

416
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,080
So what'll it be?
Mother Goose or Bambi?

417
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Are these leads on?

418
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,580
The leads are on.

419
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:43,547
Nothing in the alpha, theta,
or delta frequencies.

420
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,847
He's brain‐dead.

421
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,914
Well, maybe he can be
an organ donor.

422
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,214
Not too likely.
He has type AB blood

423
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:54,080
and that's what,
two percent of the population?

424
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:56,914
I doubt you're gonna find
many compatible candidates.

425
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,114
It's worth a try.

426
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:00,180
Sure, it is.
Talk to the mother.

427
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,147
If she won't go for it,
see if you can persuade her

428
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,680
into pulling the plug.

429
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,214
So much for my miracle.

430
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:11,314
Dr. Corday, the fertility clinic
just called.

431
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:14,614
Your patient David Gardner
is having an MI.

432
00:16:14,647 --> 00:16:16,314
His EKG was normal
this morning.

433
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:17,980
Um, is he upstairs?

434
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:19,680
They're taking him
to the ER.

435
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,714
Uh, okay.

436
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,747
Hey, I just took
an unusual complaint.

437
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,047
An elf with an attitude

438
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,247
claims you tried
to torture him

439
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,814
with the cardio version
paddles?

440
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,080
Uh, we differed
over treatment strategies.

441
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,880
I wouldn't quite
call it torture.

442
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:35,614
I know. I read the chart.

443
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,047
He's clearly a nutcase.

444
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,580
I just want to make sure
you were alright.

445
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:40,714
I'm okay.

446
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,247
Although, to be perfectly honest

447
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,814
I could have
handled it better.

448
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,914
I'm a little off
my game today.

449
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:47,980
Blame it on the holidays.

450
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:49,147
Is it a rough time
of the year for you?

451
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,980
Not usually.

452
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,814
My ex‐wife,
she sent out this newsletter

453
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,947
saying how happy she is.

454
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,114
I can't help but seeing it
as her way of saying

455
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,114
"Hey, look how well
I traded up."

456
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,947
‐ I got it.
‐ Thanks.

457
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,714
Yes, it's a tough
time of year for me too.

458
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,114
Really?

459
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:06,547
This is the first Christmas

460
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,947
since my brother
committed suicide.

461
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,780
Oh, geez.
I‐I‐I'm sorry.

462
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,180
Yeah.

463
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:14,780
It was one of those
apocalyptic cult things

464
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,214
you know, the guys
with the sneakers?

465
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,947
Oh, yeah.

466
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,014
I thought that was
a couple of years ago.

467
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:21,747
Well, he missed the big event
so he decided

468
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,980
to follow on his own.

469
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,180
Wow. I'm sorry, I..

470
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,680
...I got to say, you're handling
it better than I would've.

471
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,880
Well, I credit that
to my Grandma Lee.

472
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:32,947
She always said,
"Whatever life throws at you

473
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,714
"you have to greet it
with a smile.

474
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:35,780
"there's nothing
as contagious

475
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:38,247
"as a positive attitude."

476
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,880
You know, I think
we'd all be better off

477
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,514
if we followed
grandma's advice.

478
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,714
‐ Here we go.
‐ Coming through.

479
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay, let's take him
into trauma one.

480
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,280
Mr. Gardner.
Mr. Gardner, how are you?

481
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:50,614
My chest feels tight.
I can't breathe.

482
00:17:50,647 --> 00:17:51,980
Is this.. Is this
your patient?

483
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,014
Yep. And he's hyperventilating
like crazy.

484
00:17:54,047 --> 00:17:56,647
Okay, hook him up to a 12‐lead
EKG. And a pulse ox.

485
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,147
Start a line.
Let's get a mask on him.

486
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,914
We need to get your breathing
under control

487
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,914
so concentrate
on the breaths.

488
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:05,047
Okay. Let the breath
out slowly.

489
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:07,914
Slowly.

490
00:18:07,947 --> 00:18:09,114
Monitor's up.

491
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:11,814
Alright, yep,
pulse is up to 99.

492
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:12,880
That's a good sign.

493
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:14,714
You're gonna be fine.

494
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,647
Breathe in on
the count of five.

495
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,314
One, two..

496
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:21,814
Oh, my..

497
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,847
You‐you're David..
You're David Gardner, right?

498
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,780
That‐that trumpet soloist?

499
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,914
'I saw your guest performance
with the Chicago Symphony.'

500
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:30,680
Oh, I'm sorry.
I‐I'm Kerry Weaver.

501
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,980
Season ticketholder.

502
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:33,980
‐ 'Oh.'
‐ 'Breathe out.'

503
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,647
I just loved your
featured performance

504
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,814
in "Mahler Two."

505
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:39,647
It‐it‐it gave me shivers.

506
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,947
'Slowly..'

507
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,047
'Uh, where‐where do you
go next?'

508
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,280
B‐Boston.

509
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,214
‐ Ah, the BSO. Yes.
‐ Breathe in.

510
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,614
‐ I got the 12 leads.
‐ Breathe out.

511
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:53,114
'David, your heart
looks just...fine.'

512
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:55,314
Okay, we'll run a few tests
just to make sure

513
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:59,280
but I think that you were just
having an anxiety attack.

514
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,847
Are you a little nervous
about playing for Ozawa?

515
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,580
‐ Huh.
‐ Breathe in.

516
00:19:04,614 --> 00:19:05,914
So how long
have you had the pain?

517
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:07,814
Ever since the surgery.

518
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,780
Uh, wish I'd never had it.

519
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,814
They told me that stapling

520
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,147
my stomach would help me reduce?

521
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,847
But I haven't lost a pound yet.

522
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,747
So, have you been sticking
to the all‐liquid diet?

523
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,847
Yes.

524
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
What'd you have today?

525
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:19,314
A little blended tea.

526
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:21,114
What was in it?

527
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:22,580
Bacon and eggs.

528
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:23,614
Mr. Demisa..

529
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:26,747
But I blended it up!

530
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,547
What else did you have?

531
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,847
A smoothie.

532
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,580
And what was in that?

533
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,614
Low‐fat milk..

534
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:34,947
...some butternut squash

535
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,814
'sweet potato pancakes,
a honey‐glazed ham'

536
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:41,047
and a caramel‐orange
buche de Noel.

537
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,814
That's a full
Christmas dinner.

538
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:45,647
Oh, also,
I'm a little backed up.

539
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,614
W‐what do you mean
a little backed up?

540
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,047
Um, constipated.

541
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,214
Okay.

542
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,280
He probably busted a staple.

543
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,080
Set him up for
a Gastrografin X‐ray

544
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,314
and give him a laxative.

545
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:56,847
Ooh! I like
the chocolate ones.

546
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,014
If that's alright.

547
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,980
Dr. Carter,
I was talking to Steven..

548
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:11,047
...and he moved his arm.

549
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,814
He's having
involuntary muscle spasms.

550
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:17,214
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

551
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:20,114
Mrs. Richards, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

552
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,547
'We did a test
on Steven'

553
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,047
to, uh, check
for brain activity.

554
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,980
We didn't find any.

555
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,114
Well, then..

556
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,580
...it'll take some time, and..

557
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,747
Time isn't going to help.

558
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,914
Steven is brain‐dead

559
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:40,147
with no possibility
of recovery.

560
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,580
I know this is
a really difficult thing

561
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:44,180
to think about right now..

562
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:47,014
...but one way to salvage
something positive out of this

563
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,647
is to donate Steven 's organs.

564
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
No, I.. I can't let you
take out his organs

565
00:20:56,114 --> 00:20:57,880
when his heart
is still beating.

566
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,914
Mrs. Richards,
if that's the case

567
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:07,947
I'd ask you to consider signing
a do not resuscitate order.

568
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,780
That way, if
Steven's heart fails again

569
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:15,014
we won't subject him
to overly aggressive procedures.

570
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:18,980
'By prolonging his life
in a vegetative state.'

571
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:21,147
I can hope for
a miracle, can't I?

572
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:27,080
Well, who do we have here?

573
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:30,214
Uh, Mrs. Hutton fainted
while shopping at Lakewood Mall.

574
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,614
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
but don't you worry.

575
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,580
We're gonna have you
back on your feet in a jiff.

576
00:21:34,614 --> 00:21:37,114
Alright.

577
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,847
Have you been
hitting the nitrous?

578
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,980
Come on, Lydia.

579
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:41,614
You got to greet life
with a smile.

580
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:42,947
I do?

581
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,647
Yeah. A positive attitude
is contagious.

582
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,214
So, Mrs. Hutton, why don't you
tell me what happened?

583
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,214
I went to Field's
Night Before Christmas sale.

584
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:56,680
It was crowded, it was hot,
it was stuffy. I passed out!

585
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:59,180
‐ Very nicely put.
‐ Thanks.

586
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,814
Why don't we order Mrs. Hutton

587
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,947
some cardiac enzymes,
CBC, and a chem seven?

588
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,180
Hold it!

589
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:07,147
How much do those things cost?

590
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,914
Gosh, I don't know.

591
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:10,314
You won't tell me?

592
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:13,114
No, I mean I‐I really
don't know. Please sit up.

593
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:16,014
‐ Oh, I got your number now.
‐ Excuse me?

594
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:18,847
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, doctor?

595
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,180
Sweet‐talking me into buying

596
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,714
all those expensive tests
I don't need.

597
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,614
Okay. Ahem, I'm just trying
to make a diagnosis.

598
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:28,880
Well, I'm trying to survive
on social security.

599
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,014
'We can't all make
a doctor's salary.'

600
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:33,580
I'm sure your insurance company
will pay for the tests.

601
00:22:33,614 --> 00:22:35,714
Oh, so that's your racket.

602
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:37,247
'Ripping off
insurance companies.'

603
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,147
'It's crooks like you that
keep my premiums so high!'

604
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,047
Give me another doctor!

605
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,047
Um, Dr. Greene's the best
doctor we have, ma'am.

606
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,647
'Well, I don't like
the look of him.'

607
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,814
The way he smiles,
the way he talks.

608
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:49,547
I want another doctor!

609
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,180
Any doctor,
as long as it isn't him!

610
00:22:52,214 --> 00:22:55,614
Mr. Gardner,
your labs look stunning.

611
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,747
We should probably wait
on the cardiac enzymes

612
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,747
before letting you go.

613
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,880
Well, at this rate
I might as well

614
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,247
check in for the night, huh?

615
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,847
Well, it would certainly
save you the drive in

616
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,580
for surgery tomorrow.

617
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:08,314
No. No, the less time
I spend here, the better.

618
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:09,547
No offense.

619
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,214
None taken.

620
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:13,947
So how you feeling?

621
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,547
Oh, like an idiot.

622
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,047
Here I thought I was having
this big heart attack.

623
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,914
Turns out I 'm just
a nervous wreck.

624
00:23:20,947 --> 00:23:23,180
You know, if you wanted to,
you could postpone surgery.

625
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:27,047
No. I have to be
recovered by January 15th.

626
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm doing a televised special
with the Boston Symphony.

627
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:31,080
‐ 'Dr. Corday?'
‐ Well..

628
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:33,614
I'll have to mark my calendar.

629
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,047
Symphony fan?

630
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,547
I know very little
about orchestral music.

631
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:42,114
So what do you like?

632
00:23:42,147 --> 00:23:45,714
‐ Well..
‐ Thank you.

633
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,947
I'm..

634
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,880
I'm embarrassed to say.

635
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,980
How bad can it be?

636
00:23:56,147 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm in a disco
phase at the moment.

637
00:23:58,614 --> 00:23:59,914
Yes, well..

638
00:23:59,947 --> 00:24:01,747
I can see why
you would be embarrassed.

639
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,247
‐ You paged me?
‐ We've got a problem.

640
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,547
‐ He's stuck.
‐ Stuck?

641
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,780
He's wedged in so tight
I can't get him out.

642
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:11,180
Alright, so, what do you
expect me to do?

643
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:12,747
Could you help me
get him out?

644
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,614
Uh‐huh. I don't have
time for that.

645
00:24:14,647 --> 00:24:16,247
Just call maintenance.
Have them take the chair apart.

646
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,714
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ What now?

647
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,014
I have to go to the bathroom.

648
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,314
Uh, you're gonna
have to hold it, sir.

649
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:22,180
‐ Help!
‐ Help me get him out, please?

650
00:24:22,214 --> 00:24:24,214
‐ Please?
‐ Alright. O‐okay, okay.

651
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:26,880
Come on.
Come on, grab his arms.

652
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:28,214
Oh!

653
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,114
Alright, on my count.
One, two, three.

654
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,314
What a waste.

655
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:45,980
Why did I do it?
Oh, why did I do it?

656
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,947
I know.. I know better.

657
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,680
You were trying
to save a kid's life.

658
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:51,714
I let that instrument of
God stuff go to my head.

659
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,780
Maybe it is all arbitrary.

660
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:57,980
I mean, what did this kid do
to deserve a brain hemorrhage

661
00:24:58,014 --> 00:24:59,947
and why does it blow
on Christmas Eve?

662
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,614
What's the point?

663
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,080
Doug, I got the test back
on the teenager in one..

664
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:21,647
'Mm‐hmm, and?'

665
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,047
A little Christmas
present from the stork.

666
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,980
Alright. Well, I 'd better
go and give the good news.

667
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:28,014
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Here.

668
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:29,247
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

669
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,947
Dr. Weaver, you
have to read this.

670
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,747
‐ Read what?
‐ XXX sex fantasy.

671
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,114
Excuse me?

672
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:36,780
I found it in one
of Dr. Lee's charts.

673
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,047
It's her handwriting.

674
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,747
"I took MG's
gloved hand and placed it

675
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,847
"on my heaving,
pink‐stippled breast."

676
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,614
Why am I reading this?

677
00:25:45,647 --> 00:25:46,647
Don't you get it?

678
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,714
MG is Mark Greene.

679
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,280
Come on.

680
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,147
What about the glove reference?
Whose gloves are missing, huh?

681
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,647
Jerry, you have
completely lost your mind.

682
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,847
Oh! You found my notes
on Mrs. Condrell.

683
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,180
I've been looking up and down.

684
00:25:59,214 --> 00:26:01,780
‐ Mrs. Condrell?
‐ That psych patient?

685
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:03,314
It's a sad case.

686
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:06,780
She's psychotic,
extremely hyper‐sexual

687
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:08,714
and she has these
obsessive fantasies

688
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,947
about Merv Griffin,
of all people.

689
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,114
Anyway, thank you.

690
00:26:13,147 --> 00:26:15,247
Jerry, next time you wanna
make an ass out of yourself

691
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,214
leave me out of it, okay?

692
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,614
Could there be a mistake?

693
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,780
No, there's no mistake, Laura.

694
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,114
You're pregnant.

695
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:26,680
Oh, God.

696
00:26:26,714 --> 00:26:29,180
Now what do I do?

697
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,080
Well, is there anyone you
can talk to, your mother?

698
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:33,880
No way. She'll kill me.

699
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:35,114
What about your dad?

700
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:36,780
‐ No.
‐ Thanks.

701
00:26:36,814 --> 00:26:38,647
I had to sneak out
even to come here.

702
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,114
Mm‐hmm.

703
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:42,014
Are you gonna tell them?

704
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:44,147
Not if you don't want me to.

705
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,114
I don't.

706
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,680
Well, you have some choices.

707
00:26:50,714 --> 00:26:52,680
You can have the baby, keep it.

708
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:54,014
Have the baby,
give it up for adoption

709
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,547
or you can have an abortion.

710
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,814
I can't have a baby.

711
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:01,680
There's no way.

712
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,847
Can you help me?

713
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,114
Yes, I can. Be right back.

714
00:27:09,147 --> 00:27:11,014
Stephanie, can I..

715
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,980
Thanks.

716
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,847
Hey, Carol?

717
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,214
We got a pregnant
13‐year‐old in there

718
00:27:19,247 --> 00:27:21,280
who wants to have
an abortion on the holidays.

719
00:27:21,314 --> 00:27:24,314
‐ God. 13.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

720
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:26,047
Think you can arrange it?

721
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,214
Merry Christmas. Yeah.

722
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:30,547
Yeah. Can you
take it from there?

723
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Sure.

724
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:34,014
Carla, look. Uh, yeah,
I know his bedtime

725
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:35,580
is at 8 o'clock but
I'm getting slammed here.

726
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,180
I might not be able
to make it until then.

727
00:27:37,214 --> 00:27:40,114
Yeah, I know. Listen,
listen, listen. Okay, okay.

728
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:43,647
It's Christmas Eve. I'm just
trying to see my son, alright?

729
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,280
Okay. Thank you so much.
Oh, yeah, I promise.

730
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,080
I will. Yeah. Bye.

731
00:27:47,114 --> 00:27:48,780
‐ How's it going
‐ Don't ask.

732
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,780
Did you call the ER for Demisa?

733
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:52,047
Said he's still on the toilet.

734
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,280
Lizzie, if you're ready,
we can go together.

735
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:57,180
Um, look, I have a couple of
patients to finish with, okay?

736
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:59,114
Is Peter trying
to ruin our evening?

737
00:27:59,147 --> 00:28:00,680
No, not at all.

738
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,714
‐ Um..
‐ It was a joke.

739
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,114
Look, I 'll see you there.

740
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:06,847
Peter, I wasn't able
to finish these dictations

741
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,580
so I left them for you,
they need to be in by 8:00.

742
00:28:09,614 --> 00:28:11,547
Appreciate the help.
See you later.

743
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:19,547
16‐year‐old, unconscious
history of biliary atresia.

744
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,880
‐ Hepatic coma?
‐ Yeah. Looks like it.

745
00:28:20,914 --> 00:28:22,780
She was doing fine
until six months ago.

746
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:24,547
What medication is she on?

747
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,814
Ampicillin, tobramycin,
vitamins A, D, and K.

748
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,780
Skin's jaundiced.

749
00:28:31,614 --> 00:28:33,147
Same with sclera.

750
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,114
‐ Her breath smells sweet.
‐ Fetor hepaticus?

751
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,280
‐ Yep.
‐ What's that?

752
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,614
Liver has shut down.
Let's dip a urine.

753
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,014
It's getting
a little crowded in here.

754
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,047
Why don't you deal
with the parents, please?

755
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,814
Start lactulose, 30cc's per MG.

756
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,147
We'll give her some medicine
to clean her blood.

757
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,547
Why don't you come with me?

758
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,914
She's bleeding inside?

759
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:52,747
Her liver failure is
causing her blood not to clot.

760
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,247
Oh, God.

761
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,614
Is, uh, she on
the transplant list?

762
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,080
She's been status 2A
for six months

763
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:00,047
but we haven't been
able to find her a match.

764
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
Why not?

765
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,080
‐ What's her blood type?
‐ AB.

766
00:29:04,114 --> 00:29:05,314
What are you doing?

767
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:06,947
Are you hiding back here?

768
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,547
Exactly.

769
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,847
I tried your grandmother's

770
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,114
greet them with a smile
approach on a patient

771
00:29:12,147 --> 00:29:13,280
and she threw me out.

772
00:29:13,314 --> 00:29:16,314
‐ No.
‐ Yep.

773
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:18,247
I've decided
to restrict myself

774
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,247
to the unconscious
for the rest of the day.

775
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,147
Now, now.

776
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,747
Tell you, there's
something about me

777
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,047
that just brings out
the worst in people.

778
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,614
I've noticed that.

779
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:29,647
I'm like a magnet
for negativity.

780
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,047
People get too close

781
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,547
I'll pull the positive
right out of 'em.

782
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,080
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ What?

783
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,714
I suddenly
feel depressed.

784
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,914
‐ Low blood sugar?
‐ No, it's definitely you.

785
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:40,314
Hey, shut the hell up.

786
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,047
‐ I'm trying to sleep here.
‐ Ooh.

787
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,647
Oh, another satisfied customer.

788
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,280
Two kids come in
on Christmas Eve

789
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:49,147
one ends up brain‐dead
the other needs a liver

790
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,147
and they both have AB blood.
Tell me that's not a godsend.

791
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,780
It's not. The mother
won't consent till‐‐

792
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:55,247
She will when I get
through with her.

793
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Where's his mother?

794
00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:57,647
She's not here.

795
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,014
‐ Is he throwing PVCs?
‐ Yeah.

796
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,180
Why didn't you call me?

797
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:01,214
Let's get the pacer pads on him.

798
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:03,580
‐ Can't. DNR.
‐ What?

799
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:05,947
His mother said you
talked her into it.

800
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,214
There goes your godsend.

801
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:08,280
Did she say where she was going?

802
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:09,714
Not to me.

803
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:10,947
If she comes back,
keep her here.

804
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:14,547
Laura, Dr. Sarafini
can take you.

805
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,214
What's wrong?

806
00:30:20,247 --> 00:30:23,180
'I just keep thinking..'

807
00:30:23,214 --> 00:30:26,314
...it's a mortal sin.

808
00:30:26,347 --> 00:30:29,047
‐ Do you believe that?
‐ Doesn't matter what I believe.

809
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,147
What do you think?

810
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,114
I don't know.

811
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:36,647
Is there someone
in your family you can talk to?

812
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,914
‐ A sister maybe?
‐ No.

813
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:39,947
What about your mom?

814
00:30:40,814 --> 00:30:42,747
She'll kill me.

815
00:30:45,014 --> 00:30:47,780
Look, Laura, this isn't
gonna be easy.

816
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:51,214
But it is a very big decision.

817
00:30:51,247 --> 00:30:52,947
And I don't think
you're sure of what to do.

818
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,914
I think you really need
to talk to someone.

819
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,614
Can you call my mom?

820
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,047
Yeah, I can.

821
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,014
I'll call her, I'll call her.

822
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:17,580
She's not back yet?

823
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,147
Nope. He just
went into V‐tach.

824
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,680
'Dammit!'

825
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,247
I got a thin pulse.

826
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,014
Give him another 50 of Lidocaine

827
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:27,880
and get the paddles ready.
I take full responsibility.

828
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:29,214
Yeah, and I'll lose my license.

829
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:31,814
What are you doing?

830
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:33,714
I'll code him myself
if I have to.

831
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:35,547
You can't code him
against his mother's wishes.

832
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,114
You wanted a miracle?

833
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,647
These two kids
arriving on the same day

834
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,714
is as close as it gets.

835
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:44,047
That's what you want to believe,
she may not see it that way.

836
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,214
I'm willing to bet she does.

837
00:31:45,247 --> 00:31:46,847
You're only thinking
of yourself.

838
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,980
And a dying 16‐year‐old girl.

839
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,914
Charging at 200.

840
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Move 'em.

841
00:31:57,914 --> 00:31:59,647
Move 'em!

842
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,547
‐ Clear!
‐ You're both crazy.

843
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:03,814
Back in sinus.

844
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,014
Oh, now you did it.

845
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,314
Page me if he goes south.

846
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,980
I'm going to find his mother.

847
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,580
So which section
of the orchestra

848
00:32:10,614 --> 00:32:12,980
are you going
out with now?

849
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:15,888
No, I've been unattached

850
00:32:15,921 --> 00:32:18,121
since I started
the tour six months now.

851
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:20,188
That's a long time
to be on the road.

852
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,621
Yeah, it sure is.

853
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:24,721
Swarms of groupies
in every city.

854
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:27,888
Well, a classical soloist
doesn't quite lead

855
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:30,288
the life of a Rolling Stone.

856
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:32,821
But if I had known I was
gonna lose my prostate

857
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:36,054
I would've made more
of an effort, believe me.

858
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,021
Are you still anxious
about the surgery tomorrow?

859
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,354
I was never all that anxious
about the surgery, per se.

860
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,921
It was more the..

861
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:46,254
What?

862
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,921
You really want to know?

863
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:50,888
Yes.

864
00:32:52,988 --> 00:32:54,154
Well, I..

865
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:58,221
I went up to your clinic
to deposit my..

866
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:00,121
...DNA..

867
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,021
...and, of course, they
directed me to the cubicle

868
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:03,754
where they'd set out the..

869
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:07,288
...the specimen jar and the..

870
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,988
...men's magazine..

871
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:12,888
...and I...and I
just kept thinking..

872
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:17,221
Well, this is it. This is
my...my last sexual experience.

873
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:21,388
And I..
Well, you know the rest.

874
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:22,921
Must be the first
time in history

875
00:33:22,954 --> 00:33:24,654
that somebody's had
performance anxiety

876
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:26,621
while by himself.

877
00:33:30,054 --> 00:33:34,088
David, would you like to grab
a bite to eat somewhere?

878
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:36,221
Yes, Elizabeth,
I'd like that very much.

879
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:40,054
Alright, Mr. Demisa.
We got your X‐rays back.

880
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:43,188
They're clear, so you are..

881
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,154
Mr. Demisa?

882
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:48,954
Mr. Demisa!

883
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:53,288
Takata, you seen
our 400 pound patient?

884
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:54,721
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ What?

885
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:55,988
I'm missing five
patient dinners.

886
00:33:56,021 --> 00:33:59,688
‐ Oh, dammit.
‐ Mr. Demisa?

887
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:00,788
Mr. Demisa?

888
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,754
'Mr. Demisa!'

889
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:06,221
Mr. Demisa?

890
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:08,188
‐ 'Over here.'
‐ What is it?

891
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:10,154
Cake crumbs.
Looks like German chocolate.

892
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:14,721
Mr. Demisa? Oh, dammit.

893
00:34:14,754 --> 00:34:15,921
Mr. Demisa?

894
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,788
Alright, he's unconscious.

895
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:19,954
He vomited. There's at least
a half a gallon here.

896
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,721
Okay..

897
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:23,154
No bowel sounds,
abdomen's rigid.

898
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,288
He really did it this time.

899
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:26,154
‐ He blew a staple?
‐ Yeah.

900
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:28,154
‐ Need a gurney!
‐ Prep an OR!

901
00:34:28,188 --> 00:34:29,388
Get an X‐ray and page Romano.

902
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,988
Tell him to get
his ass back here.

903
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,221
Mrs. Richards..

904
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:45,654
I'm sorry to bother you.

905
00:34:45,688 --> 00:34:48,754
But an extraordinary
thing has happened.

906
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,154
A 16‐year‐old girl

907
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,621
with the exact same
rare blood type as Steven's

908
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:55,688
came into the ER
in liver failure.

909
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,921
Now, I can't help but to think

910
00:34:57,954 --> 00:35:01,321
that if God meant
for Steven to die tonight

911
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:03,088
at Christmas..

912
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,588
...then it must be
so that this girl can live.

913
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:10,988
I'm sorry.

914
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:15,188
But I can't think about another
child's problems right now.

915
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:19,788
All I want is for my son
to die peacefully..

916
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:21,754
...and to be buried whole.

917
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:29,021
Excuse me.

918
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:51,688
Lots of free air
under the diaphragm.

919
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:53,821
Yeah. He's perfed his stomach.

920
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,621
‐ Still no Romano?
‐ I paged him five times.

921
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,988
‐ Alright, who's on call?
‐ 'Guthrie. Just started a AAA.'

922
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:01,954
BP's dropped to 80 palp.
We can't wait much longer.

923
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,354
He's got a fever.

924
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:06,388
Alright, give him
a gram of Cefotaxime

925
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,754
500 of Flagyl and hand me
a scalpel. Let's move.

926
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:09,921
You're starting
without an attending?

927
00:36:09,954 --> 00:36:11,954
He's septic.
I don't have any choice.

928
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:13,821
We keep him on the table,
he's going to die.

929
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:19,121
'What the hell?'

930
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:21,188
Hey, Carol. Hey.

931
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,354
You see there's a priest
in there with that girl?

932
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,954
Uh‐huh.

933
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:25,754
Well, he's gonna pressure
her into having the kid.

934
00:36:25,788 --> 00:36:27,854
Well, maybe he's
gonna counsel her too.

935
00:36:27,888 --> 00:36:29,088
How'd he find out about it?

936
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:30,388
She asked me to call her mom.

937
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,754
‐ The mom brought the priest.
‐ Well..

938
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,921
‐ I wish you'd told me about it.
‐ Why?

939
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:35,888
Because I would've tried
to keep him out of there.

940
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,888
Are those baked beans?

941
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,354
Yeah.

942
00:36:41,388 --> 00:36:42,688
And French fries.

943
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:44,388
‐ Huh.
‐ Phew, that's rank.

944
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:46,088
What's this?

945
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,588
Coleslaw.

946
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,321
Ah, here's a good one.

947
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:53,121
What is that? Mystery meat?

948
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,188
What the hell
do you think you're doing

949
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:55,754
operating on my patient?

950
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:58,121
Saving his life! You jerk.

951
00:36:58,154 --> 00:37:00,721
Get me a gown and gloves, now!

952
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,654
Peter, get your hands
out of my patient.

953
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:05,121
Okay, give me
a little suction here.

954
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,154
Sucker's clogged.

955
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,054
Yeah, it's a cranberry.

956
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,288
Let's go, Shirley! Gloves!

957
00:37:14,688 --> 00:37:15,754
Where the hell is she?

958
00:37:15,788 --> 00:37:17,754
‐ Who?
‐ Who do you think?

959
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,388
What'd you do, give her extra
work to hang her up here?

960
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,188
I have no idea what
the hell you're talking about.

961
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:24,154
‐ Step away.
‐ Fine.

962
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:26,021
'Who gave you permission
to start without me?'

963
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:27,388
He was going into septic shock.

964
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:29,354
You are a resident, Peter.

965
00:37:29,388 --> 00:37:32,054
You don't take a piss
without getting permission.

966
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,721
And where the hell's Lizzie,
off doing your scut?

967
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:37,054
She left an hour ago.

968
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:42,321
What the hell did you use to
make this incision, a chainsaw?

969
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:44,121
‐ He's been drinking.
‐ What?

970
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,788
He's drunk.

971
00:37:46,821 --> 00:37:49,354
Go. Call Anspaugh. Now.

972
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:51,688
Retract the bowel.

973
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,654
Retract the bowel please.

974
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:58,088
Dr. Romano, have you
been drinking?

975
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:00,821
Are you questioning
my surgical fitness?

976
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:01,888
How many drinks have you had?

977
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,654
Go to hell.

978
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:06,088
Dr. Romano, I 'm going to have
to ask you to step back, please.

979
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:08,021
‐ Sponge.
‐ Dr. Romano!

980
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:09,621
Touch me again, Peter,
and I'll deck you.

981
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,221
‐ Give me the sponge.
‐ Look, you're drunk.

982
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:21,021
Alright, Shirley, get me
some clean gloves and a gown.

983
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:23,154
Coming right up.

984
00:38:23,188 --> 00:38:24,788
Hey, who ordered
all this stuff?

985
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:27,788
‐ What is it?
‐ Uh, pizza, beer, brandy.

986
00:38:27,821 --> 00:38:28,821
Whole bunch of spices.

987
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:30,788
Ah, the provisions have arrived.

988
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:31,888
How much do I owe the man?

989
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:33,788
$212 plus a tip.

990
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:34,821
What's goin' on?

991
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,854
Staff Christmas party.

992
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:36,888
I didn't know there was one.

993
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,054
There is now. My treat.

994
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:39,154
Alright.

995
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:41,054
You know what?
It's really crowded.

996
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,888
Can we maybe take this
stuff into the lounge?

997
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,021
Grouch.

998
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,954
Thanks, guys.

999
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:50,288
Remember to punch out
before boozing. Thanks.

1000
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,988
What do you need
brandy and spices for?

1001
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:54,721
Hot toddies.
The Sultan of Johor's favorite.

1002
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:55,954
Ah, well, if it's
good enough for the sultan.

1003
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:57,954
Yeah, make mine a double.

1004
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:00,121
Jerry, where's my lab coat?

1005
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:01,621
Uh, it was here a minute ago.

1006
00:39:01,654 --> 00:39:03,654
Now where'd it go?

1007
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:05,354
You know what? I don't even
wanna hazard a guess.

1008
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,321
That's a wise choice, Jerry.

1009
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:12,254
I admit it. There's no
such thing as miracles.

1010
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:14,888
You don't really believe that.

1011
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:17,054
I don't know what I believe.

1012
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,154
I was so sure that I was right.

1013
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,221
That I had the big
kahuna on my side.

1014
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:25,188
‐ That's pretty arrogant, huh?
‐ Very.

1015
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:32,054
What's going on?

1016
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:34,854
Apparently, Mrs. Richards
bumped into the Mikamis

1017
00:39:34,888 --> 00:39:38,921
in the hallway,
and they got to talking.

1018
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:41,621
She consented to
the liver transplant.

1019
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:45,621
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1020
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:47,088
Wait. Before you go
giving him too much credit

1021
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,721
there's something
you oughta know.

1022
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,788
What?

1023
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,721
I introduced them.

1024
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,788
What do you know?

1025
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,321
You're an instrument of God.

1026
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:57,354
Oh, please.

1027
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:08,088
Sorry.

1028
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:09,954
How sorry?

1029
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,121
Well..

1030
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:14,354
Huh..

1031
00:40:16,354 --> 00:40:19,121
Not sorry enough
to go to the mass tonight

1032
00:40:19,154 --> 00:40:20,154
if that's what you mean.

1033
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:21,954
Hmm.

1034
00:40:21,988 --> 00:40:23,854
You know what I
don't understand is..

1035
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,354
...how I can care
so much for an hot‐tempered..

1036
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:29,121
...pig‐headed heathen.

1037
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:31,088
I prefer pagan.

1038
00:40:35,654 --> 00:40:37,588
Heathen.

1039
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:46,821
Just finishing up
my disciplinary report

1040
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:49,721
recommending that your residency
be terminated for operating

1041
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:51,654
without an attending.

1042
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:53,854
You turn that in,
I'll be forced to defend myself.

1043
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,054
Ah, good luck, Peter.

1044
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:56,388
I mean, I'll have
to turn in these labs

1045
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:59,288
showing that your blood
alcohol level was .12.
