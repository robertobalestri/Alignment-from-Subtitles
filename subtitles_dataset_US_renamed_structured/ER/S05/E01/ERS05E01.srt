1
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,433
What happened? Is he okay?

2
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,566
I think he might have slipped.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,366
No. It looks to me
like he fainted.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Okay, alright, every.. Get, get
back, everybody, get back. Okay?

5
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,766
Okay. Come on now. Come on.
We got a doctor here.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,266
The hospital's right
around the corner.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,366
Some guy ran to get help.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,533
My head hurts.

9
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:36,333
This pavement's hard.

10
00:00:36,366 --> 00:00:39,433
Alright. I'll help you.
I'll help you.

11
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,133
Hey, you shouldn't move
his neck like that. Should you?

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,766
Oh, God. Are you okay?

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,433
I just told you. My head hurts.

14
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:45,800
Okay, uh, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine.

15
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,433
We're all gonna help you.

16
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,800
‐ You want us to do something?
‐ We've got to.

17
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,266
'Coming through.'

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,600
Hey, sir, are you okay?

19
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,066
Yeah. Can you help me up?

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,333
We're gonna check
you over first.

21
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:58,033
‐ What's your name?
‐ Barry Mahoney.

22
00:00:58,066 --> 00:00:59,533
‐ He fell down.
‐ Thank you.

23
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,700
And he's bleeding a little bit.

24
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:03,533
Right. Thanks.
We'll take it from here.

25
00:01:03,566 --> 00:01:05,466
'Carol, we need to
stabilize his neck.'

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,066
'I'll get a C‐collar
and a gurney.'

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,633
So Jen's gone for a month?

28
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,300
She has to take a couple
hundred depositions

29
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,500
in St. Louis, so she figured

30
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,333
it'd be easier just
to stay down there.

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,700
My head still hurts.

32
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,466
It's just a small scalp
laceration, Mr. Mahoney.

33
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Nothing to worry about.

34
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,266
And she's letting Rachel stay
with you the whole time?

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,300
No. Reluctantly, Rachel
didn't wanna miss soccer camp

36
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,633
so she's staying.

37
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,433
Okay, let's get
a saline line going

38
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,300
TKO, CBC, and a CHEM 20.

39
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,633
Want a portable C‐spine?

40
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:34,533
Yeah. Thanks. And a 12‐lead EKG.
Can we help you?

41
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,166
Just wanted to make
sure he was okay.

42
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,100
Family needs to
wait out in chairs.

43
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, I'm not family. I was
passing by and tried to help.

44
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,800
Didn't do much.
Just put her coat under my head.

45
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,166
Sure Mr. Mahoney
is very grateful.

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,300
But passersby need
to wait out in chairs, too.

47
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,233
Accu‐check, 124,
hemocue, 13.8.

48
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,700
No, actually,
I'm supposed to be right here.

49
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:53,233
I'm a third‐year
medical student.

50
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,633
I'm starting my
ER rotation today.

51
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,100
Oh, man, is that today?

52
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,566
So this lab coat
must be yours.

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,266
'Yes. So what should I do?'

54
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,566
‐ What's your name?
‐ Lucy Knight.

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,166
Well, Miss Knight,
welcome to County General.

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,366
You need to check in,
so, I think

57
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,633
you should probably
wait out in chairs.

58
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:06,700
You don't want me
to do anything?

59
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,333
Carol?

60
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,466
Uh, left down the hall,
and then a right.

61
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,100
Should I at least observe?

62
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,500
Left down the hall,
and then a right.

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,566
Hey, Luce,
did you just get here?

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,666
Bernard, what are you doing?

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,166
What happened?

66
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,066
Oh, some fire twirler
burned his butt

67
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,200
and the whole troupe's
waiting for him.

68
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,500
What is all this?

69
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,600
You look like some
geek pacing around.

70
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,433
I am a geek pacing around.

71
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,333
Taking Dr. Weaver's
audio tour of the ER.

72
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,500
Who's Dr. Weaver?

73
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:36,500
Kind of short,
red hair, uses a crutch.

74
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,233
Oh. So, what, they just
have you sitting here?

75
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,333
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

76
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,800
No one told me anything.

77
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,600
Well, I gotta get
back to my tour.

78
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:44,266
Oh, Bernard,
what are you doing later?

79
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,166
I have to practice
drawing blood.

80
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,166
They're not gonna make you
do procedures at first.

81
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,633
Alright. I'll find you.

82
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,766
‐ Come on! Out of the way!
‐ Trauma one's clear.

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,533
'What've we got, Peter?'

84
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,733
'Multiple GSWs,
head, face and chest.'

85
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:59,633
GCS 7, BP 60 palp, two
large‐bore IVs, normal saline

86
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,566
a liter and a half
in the field.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,233
'Prep a Thora‐Seal
and set up for a chest tube.'

88
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,200
‐ Ha ha. Lucy Knight?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,133
Jerry Markovic,
Unit Service Coordinator.

90
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,533
Listen, Dr. Greene's
gonna show you around

91
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,133
as soon as he
finishes with a patient.

92
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,700
So, why don't you throw
your stuff in the lounge

93
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,400
and then come on
back to the desk.

94
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,566
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I interrupt something?

95
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,100
We thought you were Jerry.

96
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:23,200
Oh, the Unit Service
Coordinator. I just met him.

97
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:24,500
You gotta love that.

98
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,233
You must be
a new med student. Right?

99
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,733
‐ Yeah.
‐ Jerry's the desk clerk.

100
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,700
He only pulls that
unit thing on newcomers.

101
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,333
'It's his birthday.'

102
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,466
Don't tell him
about the cake. Okay?

103
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh, no. Of course not.

104
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:35,266
‐ Chuny Marquez.
‐ Lily Jarvik.

105
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,433
‐ Yosh Takata.
‐ Lucy Knight.

106
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:38,166
Uh, should I use a lock..?

107
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,066
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Jerry.

108
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh, he went down
to the roach coach

109
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,533
to get his
Breakfast Burrito.

110
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,800
And that's why
my dad says he's..

111
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,633
‐ Ha ha ha.
‐ Oh, what did you do?

112
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,033
Um, not much, actually.

113
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,266
I was hoping Jerry knew

114
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,033
if there were any
extra lab coats around.

115
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,633
Oh, they keep them
under the desk.

116
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,800
Great. So your
dad works here?

117
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,766
Yeah. He's one of the bosses.

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,733
Well, he used to
be the only boss

119
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,233
until Dr. Weaver butted in.

120
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,400
Oh, here they are. Thanks.

121
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,066
‐ What's your name?
‐ Rachel.

122
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,066
‐ I'm Lucy. Oh, hi.
‐ Hello again. Mark Greene.

123
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,366
‐ Lucy.
‐ Knight. I remember.

124
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,066
Rachel, what are you
still doing here?

125
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,533
I'm watching the desk for Jerry.

126
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:15,800
Uh, only for a moment.

127
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,166
Mrs. Williams doesn't
pick me up until 8:30.

128
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,033
Yeah? Well, it's 8:35.

129
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,366
Good luck on your game.

130
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I'll pick you up at
the Williams' before dinner.

131
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:25,100
‐ Okay. Bye.
‐ Okay. Bye.

132
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,500
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye, Jerry. Happy birthday.

133
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,100
Thanks, Rach.

134
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,533
‐ Settling in?
‐ Well, actually, I haven't‐‐

135
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,433
Jerry, would you call
radiology and tell them

136
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:33,566
to hurry up on those films
for that clavicle in two?

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,466
I was waiting on chairs
just like you said.

138
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,233
That leg lac
in four needs sutures.

139
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,266
Doyle or Carter.

140
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
Yosh Takata, Lucy Knight.

141
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,566
‐ Hi.
‐ We met.

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,633
Sitting in chairs, huh?
Well, we better get you going.

143
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,700
We'll start off with charts,
then the board, quickie tour.

144
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:49,233
And then we'll see if you're
ready for some patients.

145
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,033
Aren't I supposed to be
assigned to a resident?

146
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,033
Later. First grab a chart
and pick up your patient.

147
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,500
No jumping over for
a more interesting case.

148
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:59,466
Then put your initials here,
patient's name, chief complaint

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,366
and what labs
or films you've ordered.

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Why don't you try one?

151
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:04,233
Uh, patient's name is Clements

152
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:07,233
and chief complaint
is "mult lac?"

153
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,666
Multiple lacerations, right?

154
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,066
Waiting on a head CT
and suturing.

155
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Doctor is MD, which doesn't
actually stand for "doctor."

156
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,533
That means "Maggie Doyle."

157
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:17,466
Don't worry. You'll catch on.

158
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
So you thinking about emergency
medicine for your residency?

159
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:22,033
I'm not sure.
This is my first rotation.

160
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,066
Curtain Area 1,
Curtain Area 2.

161
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,633
Exam Room 1,
this is Exam Room 2.

162
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:30,233
‐ Oh, and this is Dr. Carter.
‐ What?

163
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,166
Carter's one of our finest
second‐year residents.

164
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Even though he does appear
to be sleeping on the job.

165
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,133
Lucy Knight,
third‐year med student.

166
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,433
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi. Sorry, Dr. Greene.

167
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,733
I haven't been getting much
sleep since I took that RA job.

168
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,800
Uh, life in the dorm, huh?

169
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,566
Better you than me.

170
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,733
Patients, Carter.
The place is lousy with them.

171
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,200
Right.

172
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,466
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

173
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,700
This is trauma one,
which I think, you've seen.

174
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,600
‐ Who're we saving?
‐ Nobody. He's arrested twice.

175
00:06:56,633 --> 00:07:00,100
Another soldier to the drug war.
Tucked away in his pants.

176
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,566
I'd like you to meet
Lucy Knight, third year.

177
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,333
Doctors Benton and Weaver.

178
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,333
Nurses Lydia Wright
and Malik McGrath.

179
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,100
Two units O‐neg on the infuser.

180
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,200
Do you know Mr. Gamely?

181
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,033
Bernard? Uh, yeah,
I just saw him.

182
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,666
As soon as he's done with
the headset tour I'll find you.

183
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,333
‐ Think you'll find it useful.
‐ Okay.

184
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:15,466
BP's 40 palp.

185
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,366
'He's flatline.'

186
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,133
'Thoracotomy tray.
Come on, Malik. Let's move.'

187
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,300
'Need another test‐tube.'

188
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,000
Trauma two, blissfully quiet,
which is the way we like it.

189
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,400
This is the suture room
where Dr. Doyle is suturing.

190
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,666
Lucy Knight, third year.

191
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,266
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey. Nice to meet you.

192
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh, who's Sleeping Beauty?

193
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,533
Uh, Mr. Clements passed out.

194
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,300
He got way too drunk
and walked through

195
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,533
a plate glass window.
You idiot.

196
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,466
Dr. Doyle likes to throw
in a little attitude

197
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,733
when presenting a patient.

198
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,066
Is he gonna be okay?

199
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,500
Oh, yeah, as long as
he doesn't mind

200
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,000
some big, gnarly scars.

201
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,366
‐ Mr. Gamely, I presume?
‐ Yeah.

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,500
Alright. Drug lockup's in here.

203
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:55,566
Lab is down the hall.
Radiology around the corner.

204
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,633
Exam Room 4.

205
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,666
Sorry to barge in.
Hey, you got a minute?

206
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,200
Sure. Be right back.

207
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,800
Lucy Knight, third year,
Doug Ross, pediatrician.

208
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,333
‐ Hi, how you doin'?
‐ Hi, fine.

209
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,800
Uh, alright, Miss Knight

210
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,666
why is otitis media found
primarily in children?

211
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,433
Because they have
short Eustachian tubes

212
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,366
so the fluid doesn't
drain properly and makes it

213
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,133
the perfect medium
for bacterial infections.

214
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,400
Okay. Treatment?

215
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,333
Um, Amoxicillin or Pediazole

216
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:21,566
although current thinking holds
that we may be over treating

217
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,266
because many of
the cases are viral.

218
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,433
So antibiotics aren't necessary
and may contribute to‐‐

219
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,733
Uh. Okay. Pretty good.
Textbook answer.

220
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,600
You wanna see some real Pedes
cases, you come see me. Okay?

221
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,800
‐ Mark.
‐ 'Elizabeth.'

222
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,466
'Lucy Knight, third year.'

223
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,266
Dr. Corday, surgical
resident in cowboy boots.

224
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,566
Aren't they fabulous?

225
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,466
Just back from
an interview in Denver.

226
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
‐ How do you do?
‐ Nice to meet you.

227
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,133
How was your trip?

228
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,266
Oh, the interview was fine,
the mountains are lovely.

229
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,566
But the city's
a bit flat, isn't it?

230
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,266
Now, don't let the
residents abuse you.

231
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,066
You're here to learn, not
be their indentured servant.

232
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,500
‐ See you later, Mark.
‐ Thank you.

233
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,533
Mark, labs are back
on that rule‐out MI.

234
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,233
Uh! Thanks, Lily.

235
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,066
Okay. well, that's about
the lay of the land.

236
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,700
So, I'm gonna go check on a
patient. I'll find you later.

237
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:01,766
‐ What am I supposed to do?
‐ Well, grab a chart.

238
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,566
Help someone out.
Just jump right in.

239
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,300
'Uh, 5 mgs three minutes ago,
total of 8.'

240
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,166
‐ How long has he been down?
‐ Twenty‐five minutes.

241
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,233
Let's call it.

242
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,233
Alright. Time of death, 8:49.

243
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,133
Nice try, everybody.

244
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,433
'I gotta get back upstairs.'

245
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:27,266
'Yeah. I'll handle the chart.'

246
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,633
Hey, you wanna wrap, or shall I?

247
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,466
‐ I'll do it.
‐ See ya.

248
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,666
‐ Is that it?
‐ I gotta get the death kit.

249
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Hang out. I'll show you how we
do it.

250
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:59,066
Uh, excuse me?

251
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,433
Somebody?

252
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,266
Um, his phone's ring..

253
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,533
His phone's ringing.

254
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,666
Hello.

255
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,566
Um...no, I'm sorry.

256
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,100
He can't come
to the phone right now.

257
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, yeah. I‐I suppose
I could take a message.

258
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,600
'Remember where Radiology is.'

259
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:33,666
'Continue to your left now'

260
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,133
'on down to the end of the hall'

261
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,633
'and proceed
seven steps forward.'

262
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,233
'You have now reached
the admit desk.'

263
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,300
'The veritable heartbeat
of every emergency room.'

264
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:47,800
'We'll return for
a complete orientation..'

265
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,100
Oh, it's not mine.

266
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,366
Bernard, what is with
this thing?

267
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm never where she
says I'm supposed to be.

268
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,800
Neither was I.
You know what?

269
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,300
This morning when
I saw you in chairs

270
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,633
I was supposed to be
in a suture room.

271
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,266
Do you think we're starting
at the wrong point?

272
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,600
I know I have.

273
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:01,466
I wanted medicine rotation.

274
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,266
This Dr. Doyle has latched
on to me in a big way.

275
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,366
And we haven't even been
assigned a resident yet.

276
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,233
Hasn't stopped her from turning
me into a urine delivery serv..

277
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,800
Can you remember
where the lab is?

278
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,566
All I know is it wasn't
where it was supposed to be.

279
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,666
‐ Miss Knight.
‐ See ya.

280
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,200
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

281
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,533
Yeah, the tour's
very helpful, isn't it?

282
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:18,233
Yes, thank you.

283
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:21,200
Um, as chief will you be the one
assigning us to residents?

284
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,133
‐ I'm acting chief.
‐ Oh.

285
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,266
Kerry.

286
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Yeah, Doug,
you were looking for me?

287
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,566
Yeah. I have to do an LP

288
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,266
on a two‐year‐old
boy in Exam 3.

289
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,066
Rule out meningitis?

290
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,066
‐ Yes.
‐ And what are the symptoms?

291
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
Excuse us for a second?

292
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:36,800
Just a second.

293
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,700
Kerry, I'm not here
to present the case.

294
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:41,166
I'm here to inform you about a
procedure that needs to be done.

295
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
The parents are out waiting,
if you'd like to join us.

296
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:46,600
You know what, Don Anspaugh
and legal mandated the terms

297
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,366
of your situation, not me.

298
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,366
Mm‐hmm. Well, and those
terms do not include me

299
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,166
having to justify a procedure.

300
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,100
Be right there.

301
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,166
You know, why don't you finish
the tour, grab Dr. Carter

302
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,066
see if he can pull you
in on some patients.

303
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,066
Hey, can you hold this
corner up for a second?

304
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,566
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

305
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,300
Getting things ready for
my surprise birthday party.

306
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,333
This year's surprise,
there is no party.

307
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,666
Then why do you have
that cake in the lounge?

308
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,066
‐ I didn't tell him.
‐ I know.

309
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,500
He sniffs that out every year.

310
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,466
Well, you hide it in
the same place every year.

311
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,700
Patient's eight.

312
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,066
Huh, how long has he
had the rash?

313
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,766
His mom say
for about three weeks.

314
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,333
I'm having a hard time
diagnosing it.

315
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,433
‐ How's it going, Miss Knight?
‐ Uh, fine.

316
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:30,566
Uh, Dr. Weaver suggested
I work with Dr. Carter

317
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,033
on some of his patients.

318
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:33,466
Carter, you wanna fill her in?

319
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,433
Eight‐year‐old
with erythematous macules

320
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,766
and small papules
on the trunk and back.

321
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,100
‐ Okay. What's the distribution?
‐ Kinda spread out like a fan.

322
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:44,166
Does it resemble
a Christmas tree?

323
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,733
Yeah. I guess
you could say that.

324
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,566
Sounds like pityriasis rosea.

325
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,733
Classic Christmas tree
pattern on the back.

326
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:51,300
I think she's right.

327
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,633
Using a computer.

328
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,333
Ahem, why don't you
let Dr. Ross take a look

329
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,600
and then you and Miss Knight

330
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:00,266
can move on to
the gentleman with hematuria.

331
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,566
Okay.

332
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
‐ I'll meet you in Exam 4.
‐ Sure.

333
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,200
Did I say the wrong thing?

334
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,033
In general
it's probably not a good idea

335
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,266
to show up the residents.

336
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,233
So I should give
the wrong answer.

337
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,633
Tricky, isn't it?

338
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,466
Welcome aboard.

339
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,400
And when did you first notice
blood in your urine, Mr. Zwicki?

340
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,200
Just a couple days ago.

341
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,366
Listen this couldn't be
related to exhaustion, could it?

342
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,633
I've been finishing up
this renovation

343
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,300
on a two‐story in Oak Park.

344
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,133
Working long hours?

345
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,700
Ha ha. Needed to bring
it in before the penalty.

346
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,433
I don't think that's it.
Any fever?

347
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,500
‐ No.
‐ Back pain?

348
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:34,433
Well, just the usual from work.

349
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,266
How about weight loss?

350
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,433
Um, I always drop a little
at the end of a job. You know?

351
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:41,733
You skip a meal here and there.

352
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:43,100
Mm‐hmm.

353
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,366
Is it gonna be much longer?

354
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,700
‐ I'm gonna order some tests.
‐ Mm.

355
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:47,433
We'll know more then.

356
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:51,766
Connie, let's get a CBC,
coag panel, UA, CHEM 7.

357
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,300
You got it.

358
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,333
‐ Peed in this cup for you.
‐ Thank you.

359
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,600
We'll be back in a bit.

360
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm sorry about
coming up with

361
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,233
that rash diagnosis
before you did.

362
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:05,400
No problem.
Fair is fair.

363
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,500
I just hope this doesn't mean

364
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:07,533
I'm not gonna get
to do anything.

365
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:08,700
I've spent two years learning

366
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:10,266
how to take a history
and a physical.

367
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,666
I'm willing to help
with patients.

368
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,766
Oh, hey, Carter,
I am jammed.

369
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,466
Can you take Mrs. Lydell

370
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,300
a foot ulcer in Curtain 3?

371
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,466
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

372
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,600
She's all yours.

373
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,433
Do the H&P, make an assessment
and a plan, then come find me.

374
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:33,100
‐ Mrs. Lydell?
‐ Yes, I surely am.

375
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,366
I'm Lucy Knight.

376
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,133
Uh, would it be okay
if I just check you over

377
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,666
and ask you a few questions?

378
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,600
Child, the good Lord has seen
fit to put me into your hands.

379
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,633
Now, I receive you just as
he receives us both.

380
00:14:44,766 --> 00:14:46,566
Order a cross table,
C‐spine and portable chest.

381
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
‐ Pelvis?
‐ Sure.

382
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,033
‐ Dr. Carter.
‐ I'm a little busy.

383
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,600
Labs are back on Mr. Zwicki.

384
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,633
‐ Pulse ox is 92, BP 90 palp.
‐ Put them in his chart.

385
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,666
Let's get another
large‐bore IV going.

386
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,333
After that we may
need a central line.

387
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:58,221
‐ I'll do it.
‐ His crit doesn't look good.

388
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,855
I'll check it
as soon as I can.

389
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:03,121
‐ Go ahead, Carter. I've got it.
‐ No, really, it's okay.

390
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:05,821
We're covered here.
Come on, go, go, go. Go!

391
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:10,688
Seven gloves,
betadine and a spiral..

392
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:14,721
Hematocrit's 30?

393
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:15,988
So he's pretty anemic, right?

394
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,021
Yep.

395
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,788
Urinalysis shows red blood cells

396
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,421
too numerous to count,
but only two to three WBCs.

397
00:15:21,455 --> 00:15:23,355
BUN and creatinine are normal.

398
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:25,155
Ah, with the gross
hematuria and the anemia

399
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,188
we definitely need
to admit him for more tests.

400
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:29,121
Hey, can you give me
the differential diagnosis

401
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:32,021
at this point?
Without using the computer?

402
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,788
Um, with weight loss
and painless hematuria

403
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,021
cancer's high on the list.

404
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,188
Uh, kidney tumor,
carcinoma of the bladder

405
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,888
prostate cancer,
renal tuberculosis‐‐

406
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,855
‐ Good job.
‐ Thanks.

407
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:44,988
Oh, good. Listen,
I was just coming to find you.

408
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:46,688
I gotta get going.

409
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,421
You know, my poor wife,
she's been in that waiting room

410
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:49,888
for the last two hours.

411
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,821
‐ Your lab results are back.
‐ Yeah.

412
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:55,288
And they indicate that
there may be a serious problem.

413
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,888
We'd like to admit you
for a few days

414
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,421
to do a full
diagnostic evaluation.

415
00:15:58,455 --> 00:15:59,988
No, I can't do that.

416
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,788
I start a huge
renovation tomorrow.

417
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:03,088
Townhouse on the Gold Coast.

418
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,321
Well, I'm sure it could
wait a couple of days.

419
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:05,788
No, it can't.

420
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:08,121
Your condition
could be very serious.

421
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,455
There is a possibility
of cancer.

422
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,955
And I really think
you should get it checked out.

423
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:16,888
Now, look, come on now.

424
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:19,455
A buddy of mine found
a little blood in his piss

425
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,788
and it turned out
to be a urine infection.

426
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:24,121
So, can't you just
give me some antibiotics?

427
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,121
Can't really do that.

428
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:31,821
We should bring your wife up
to speed, if that's alright?

429
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:35,055
‐ Yeah. Yeah.
‐ It's okay? We'll be back.

430
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,155
You have to let him go?

431
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:40,955
If he insists,
but you have to know

432
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:42,688
what technique to use
to get him to stay.

433
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:44,121
In this case, we use his wife.

434
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:45,355
What do you mean?

435
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,755
We'll give her
the full picture.

436
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,121
The possibility of cancer

437
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:49,788
the importance
of early detection.

438
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:50,855
Ten minutes alone
with him in the room

439
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:52,421
she'll change his mind.

440
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,055
Lydia, did Dr. Weaver
do that central line yet?

441
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,121
Just about to.

442
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:57,221
I'm just gonna
go check with her.

443
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,688
See if she needs any help.

444
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,355
I'm looking for Mrs. Zwicki.

445
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,421
Yes.

446
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,788
Mrs. Zwicki?

447
00:17:06,821 --> 00:17:08,188
My name is Lucy Knight.

448
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:11,088
And, uh, I'd like to talk
to you about your husband.

449
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,688
His condition could
be very serious.

450
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,921
What do you mean?

451
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:18,155
Well, with the
painless hematuria

452
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,221
there's a chance
of renal vein thrombosis

453
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:23,055
polycystic kidney disease,
glomerulonephritis

454
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:24,421
and renal or ureteral calculi‐‐

455
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,288
Wait. I don't understand this.

456
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:28,088
Well, your husband would
like to leave AMA.

457
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,121
But we'd like to check him in
and do some more tests.

458
00:17:30,155 --> 00:17:31,155
Tests?

459
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:33,355
Do an IVP,
get an abdominal CT.

460
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:34,988
Check his urine for AFBs

461
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,821
maybe check a PSA,
and possibly do a cystoscopy.

462
00:17:37,855 --> 00:17:38,921
I don't think this
is a good idea.

463
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,388
It would just be
a couple of days.

464
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,421
‐ I think we're out this way.
‐ What's going on?

465
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:44,255
The Zwickis have
decided to leave.

466
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:47,955
Mrs. Zwicki, I need to tell you
about your husband's condition.

467
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:49,221
Look, she explained everything.

468
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:50,688
He's incredibly stubborn.

469
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,055
No, look, I am not stubborn.

470
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,788
I feel fine and I got
a new job to start tomorrow.

471
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,355
You see, summer, that's
when I get my work.

472
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:58,121
And I can't blow this job off.

473
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,955
‐ Uh, Mr. Zwicki...please.
‐ No, I'll tell you what.

474
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:01,955
Let me tell you,
if this doesn't clear up

475
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:05,455
then I'll make arrangements to
get with my regular doc, okay?

476
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,921
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.
Come on, let's go.

477
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,788
‐ You talked to her.
‐ I thought you said to go‐‐

478
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:14,421
What did you say?

479
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,921
I told her about the chances
of hypernephroma, prostatic‐‐

480
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:18,421
‐ In those words?
‐ Yes.

481
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,688
Is there a problem, Carter?

482
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:21,121
‐ Mark.
‐ Just a second, Carol.

483
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,721
The patient wanted to leave AMA.

484
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,321
Miss Knight mistakenly
explained his condition

485
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:26,088
in medical rather
than layman terms.

486
00:18:26,121 --> 00:18:28,155
Why is a third‐year medical
student doing explaining?

487
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:29,388
'Where were you?'

488
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,021
I was assisting
Dr. Weaver in the Trauma.

489
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,755
‐ I didn't tell her to do it.
‐ Yes, you did.

490
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,121
Look, I hate to break in,
we've got a helicopter

491
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,455
landing with a
blunt head trauma.

492
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:36,721
You told me to
give her the full picture.

493
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,355
I didn't mean you!

494
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,788
Miss Knight, why don't
you come with us?

495
00:18:52,788 --> 00:18:54,455
27‐year‐old firefighter.

496
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,255
Fell 20 feet on to concrete
with blunt head trauma

497
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,455
and loss of consciousness.

498
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:01,721
BP 150 over 90, pulse 60.

499
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,821
Apneic and intubated on scene.

500
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,088
Pupils four millimeters
and sluggish.

501
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,121
I thought you said
you intubated.

502
00:19:07,155 --> 00:19:08,721
We lost the tube
en route.

503
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,121
We didn't have
a laryngoscope up in the air.

504
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,455
Why the private chopper?

505
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,755
It was already on the scene.

506
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,355
Help. Oh, no.

507
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:29,855
Please, help me.

508
00:19:29,888 --> 00:19:31,421
Please!

509
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:33,888
Please!

510
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,388
8.0 ET tube, suction.

511
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:56,355
BP's 160 over 95,
pulse 62, pulse ox 92.

512
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,088
‐ Carol, stabilize the neck.
‐ What do we got?

513
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:01,355
Uh, Emile Fernandez,
27‐year‐old firefighter.

514
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:03,788
Fell 20 feet on to concrete.

515
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:06,221
Blunt head trauma,
loss of consciousness.

516
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,421
Alright. I'll check his belly.

517
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:08,921
‐ Did you get locked out?
‐ Yes.

518
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,455
Pretty miserable.
Happened to me once.

519
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:11,921
'Second line is in.
18 gauge, left forearm.'

520
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:13,355
Okay. I'm in.

521
00:20:13,388 --> 00:20:15,055
‐ Good bowel sounds.
‐ Peritoneal lavage?

522
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,955
No. He's hemodynamically stable.

523
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,888
Let's get a head
and abdominal CT.

524
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:22,155
Alright. Pulse ox...92

525
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,688
95, 96.

526
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,155
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

527
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,421
No tracheal shift
or jugular venous distention.

528
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,755
Thank you, doctors.

529
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:30,855
Alright. Call us
when the CT's back.

530
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,855
He needs a Foley and an NG Tube.

531
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,255
We thought maybe you decided
to leave on that chopper.

532
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:37,155
‐ Sorry.
‐ 'First hemoglobin 14.2.'

533
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:38,855
Why don't you come over here?

534
00:20:38,888 --> 00:20:40,988
‐ I need more tubes.
‐ Yeah.

535
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,455
‐ He was a firefighter?
‐ He is a firefighter.

536
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:46,121
'Urine's clear,
dip's negative for blood.'

537
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,855
Glasgow Coma Scale,
how do you do it?

538
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:50,855
Uh, check for eye opening
verbal activity, motor response.

539
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:53,188
‐ CT's ready.
‐ No verbal with ET.

540
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,921
‐ Or anything in the field?
‐ Nothing at all.

541
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,288
Alright. That will be a one.

542
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,688
What about eye opening?

543
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,788
Um, spontaneous eye
opening is a five.

544
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:02,021
Alright. Well, we definitely
don't have that.

545
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,921
Emile, open your eyes.

546
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,955
Emile, open your eyes!

547
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:08,888
‐ Now what?
‐ Painful stimulus.

548
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:11,188
Eh. No eye opening with pain.

549
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:12,821
That's a one.

550
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,421
Okay. How much for
decorticate posturing?

551
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:15,788
Two.

552
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,288
That would be 4 out of 15.

553
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:20,088
You get a three for being alive.

554
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,855
'Pulse ox 98. ABG.'

555
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:25,355
Absent corneal reflex.

556
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,155
‐ What does that indicate?
‐ No brain stem activity.

557
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,421
Ready for the C‐spine.

558
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,421
Back up.

559
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,221
So what are
you thinking?

560
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,955
‐ Subdural or epidural hematoma.
‐ That would be great.

561
00:21:36,988 --> 00:21:38,355
Something we could actually fix.

562
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,855
What if there's no
bleeding in the skull?

563
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,221
Diffuse brain swelling.

564
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,988
So, we'd be looking
at a chronic vegetative state

565
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:45,955
or a potential organ donor.

566
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:49,055
Dr. Greene, Captain Matson.

567
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,021
The guys wanna know.
How's he doing?

568
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:53,021
Well, it's, uh,
it's too early to say.

569
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:55,410
We'll know more
when the CT comes back.

570
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:56,610
We screwed up, didn't we?

571
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:58,344
Bringing him in
on that private chopper?

572
00:21:58,377 --> 00:22:00,244
The airfield was there.
It was the fastest way.

573
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,444
Yeah, but we lost his ET tube.
We didn't have any equipment.

574
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:03,844
If you waited for the Medevac

575
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:05,610
it could have been
another 15 to 20 minutes.

576
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:07,510
'Yeah, at least we would
have had more medical supplies.'

577
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,377
Guys, guys, come on,
you didn't screw anything up.

578
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,377
'You bagged him,
kept the airway open.'

579
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,710
Truth is, I probably
would have done the same thing.

580
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,710
Any family?

581
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:18,177
Wife and two kids.

582
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:20,477
Thanks, doc.

583
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,644
You didn't tell
them his condition.

584
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,310
Well, I don't really
know what that is yet.

585
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,344
You're right.
I didn't tell them.

586
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:30,944
Why don't you stick
with me on this case?

587
00:22:30,977 --> 00:22:33,477
I'll call you when
the CT comes back.

588
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,710
We should just have
the cake at the admit desk.

589
00:22:37,744 --> 00:22:38,810
'No surprise in that.'

590
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:39,910
You could put it
in an Exam Room

591
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,544
have him check on a patient.

592
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,710
‐ 'Didn't we do that last year?'
‐ The last two years.

593
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:47,744
‐ Kind of noisy, huh?
‐ No place to work around here.

594
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,944
Nope. But, hey,
at least you get a locker.

595
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,177
I didn't get one for the first
two months I was here.

596
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,810
Yeah. I guess some resident
left the program or something.

597
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:57,877
Right.
Dr. Del Amico.

598
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,644
She went back to Philadelphia
to work in the pediatric ER.

599
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:01,910
We don't have one here?

600
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:04,877
Mm‐mm. Might get one
if Dr. Ross has his way.

601
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,877
Anyway, Anna...Dr. Del Amico

602
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,944
thought it was a better
opportunity for her.

603
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:13,944
Her family's there.

604
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,310
That's where she's from.

605
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:19,644
There was this boyfriend
that she was involved with.

606
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,610
Hmm.

607
00:23:23,644 --> 00:23:25,544
Anyway, you got
a locker out of it.

608
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:28,844
I'm sorry about Mr. Zwicki.

609
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:31,444
I really thought you asked
me to talk to his wife.

610
00:23:34,977 --> 00:23:37,177
Sometimes the Suture Room
is pretty quiet.

611
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:43,410
Baker, Shelly,
chart number 13940.

612
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:46,910
Admitted January 12, 1998,
with a fever of 102.

613
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,777
Respiratory distress.

614
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,510
Oh, it's been a crazy day.
I've been swamped.

615
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,344
So Reese couldn't even
get the hearing test?

616
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:56,344
'No, no, no,
he had an ear infection.'

617
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:57,944
'That's probably been the cause
of all this stuff anyway.'

618
00:23:57,977 --> 00:24:00,177
'Oh. That's good, anyway.'

619
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,177
'Yeah, so he's gonna be on
Augmentin for another week.'

620
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,844
'Then he'll take the test
and clear this thing up.'

621
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,177
'Mm‐hmm.'

622
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:10,477
'What?'

623
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,544
I, uh, I can't believe
you're wearing those boots.

624
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,844
'When in Rome.'

625
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:19,544
'So...whoo! How was Rome?'

626
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:22,210
'Denver is not Rome.'

627
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:23,344
'Mm‐mm.'

628
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:24,844
I went to
a fantastic rodeo, though

629
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,910
'but, uh, I didn't really
care for the hospital.'

630
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,777
'Let's say,
it's rather regimented.'

631
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,277
'Mm‐mm. I heard,
there's a surgical program.'

632
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,210
Look, I want to stay in Chicago.

633
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:36,410
You know, Cromley may
offer me a sponsorship.

634
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,910
Good.

635
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,610
I'm glad you're, uh, staying.

636
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:43,677
Well, trying to stay.

637
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,677
‐ Hmm, you are, are you?
‐ Yeah.

638
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,644
Ah! I missed you.

639
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:54,610
'Well, tha‐that's very nice
of you to say, Peter.'

640
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:56,944
I missed you, too.

641
00:24:56,977 --> 00:25:00,310
Yeah. It was a little, uh..

642
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:03,210
‐ Cold between the sheets.
‐ Uh‐huh.

643
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,910
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

644
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:11,810
Stop being so shocked
and come over here.

645
00:25:30,477 --> 00:25:32,444
Has it been six months?

646
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:35,810
‐ It seems like it, doesn't it?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

647
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,310
Lucy, right?

648
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,910
Yeah.
And you are?

649
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,644
Malik. Yeah, Carter
was looking for you.

650
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:53,877
He's checking on that
pregnant lady over in Exam 2.

651
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,877
Thanks.

652
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,644
Exam 2.

653
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,644
‐ Exam 2?
‐ Unh‐unh. Curtain 3.

654
00:26:07,677 --> 00:26:09,410
Exam 2 is back towards admit.

655
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,877
Thanks.

656
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:15,510
‐ Exam 2?
‐ Just past Curtain 2.

657
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,177
Hang a left.

658
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,777
Curtain 2.
Exam 2.

659
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,677
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

660
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,510
Are you the doctor?

661
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,844
No. I'm Lucy Knight.

662
00:26:28,877 --> 00:26:30,944
I'll be assisting the doctor.

663
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:32,177
Oh.

664
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,210
Who should be here any second.

665
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,944
Hi, Mrs. Draper, I'm Dr. Carter.

666
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:49,544
I understand you're
about nine weeks pregnant.

667
00:26:49,577 --> 00:26:52,244
This is my third pregnancy.

668
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,210
Mrs. Draper's had
two previous miscarriages.

669
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:58,944
Mm. I see that you've
been experiencing some..

670
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:00,577
...cramping and some bleeding.

671
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,877
Spotting.
I had some spotting yesterday.

672
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,410
And it's heavier today
and I passed some clots.

673
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:11,177
BP's 110 over 75, pulse a 100.

674
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,810
And how many pads have you used?

675
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:16,544
Um, one yesterday
and four today.

676
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:17,944
‐ Any fever?
‐ No.

677
00:27:17,977 --> 00:27:19,877
‐ Any burning on urination?
‐ 'No.'

678
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,310
Good.

679
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:24,377
Let's get a CBC, type and RH.

680
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,377
Dip a urine and check an ICON.

681
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,910
Are there any family members
we can call for you?

682
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:33,810
I've already talked
to my husband.

683
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:35,477
Okay.

684
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,577
'Okay, we're gonna
do a few tests.'

685
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,810
Then I'm going to come back
and do a pelvic exam.

686
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:43,244
Then we'll know better
where we stand, okay?

687
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:45,210
‐ Okay.
‐ We'll be right back.

688
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,844
‐ Tell me when the ICON's back.
‐ Okay.

689
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,210
I should probably stay out
while you do the pelvic, right?

690
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:53,644
Aren't gonna learn
much if you do.

691
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:55,344
Yeah, but I just thought
she seemed really distraught.

692
00:27:55,377 --> 00:27:57,244
Yeah, she is.

693
00:27:57,277 --> 00:27:58,844
But it doesn't have anything to
do with you being in the room.

694
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,777
Miss Knight, CT's back on that
firefighter if you wanna see it.

695
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,644
Alright. Yeah,
let me put my stuff down.

696
00:28:03,677 --> 00:28:05,677
Okay, tell me what you see.

697
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,677
Any intracranial bleeding?

698
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,844
I'll give you a hint.

699
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:11,610
Blood appears white
on the CT scan.

700
00:28:11,644 --> 00:28:13,410
‐ I don't see any.
‐ Right.

701
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:15,477
No subdural or
epidural hematoma.

702
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,810
Which means there's
nothing they can do surgically.

703
00:28:17,844 --> 00:28:20,310
‐ That's not good, huh?
‐ It's not good at all.

704
00:28:20,344 --> 00:28:21,744
Look at the ventricles.

705
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:24,810
The brain is so swollen that
they're all squashed down.

706
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:26,877
All along the border of
the white and gray matter.

707
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,344
Tiny punctate hemorrhages
from the axonal shearing.

708
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,477
Most of his brain's
been destroyed.

709
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,310
So, what do you do now?

710
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:37,944
Give him steroids,
hyperventilate him.

711
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,944
Have Neurosurgery put
in an ICP monitor

712
00:28:39,977 --> 00:28:41,177
and wait for the wife.

713
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,210
Dr. Greene?

714
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,810
‐ Not too good, is it?
‐ No.

715
00:28:46,844 --> 00:28:48,544
Thanks for talking
with us afterwards.

716
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:50,310
The captain and I
get into it sometimes.

717
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:53,577
‐ Your basic turf war?
‐ I hate to call it that.

718
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,710
You seem like
you must have worked

719
00:28:54,744 --> 00:28:55,777
with paramedics
in the field before.

720
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,310
Bah! Mostly just in here.

721
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,610
You wanna think about doing it?

722
00:28:58,644 --> 00:29:00,344
There's a position opening up.

723
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:02,244
District Medical Director
for EMS.

724
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,544
And what exactly is that?

725
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,444
Oversee paramedic education,
ride‐alongs.

726
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:09,244
Help determine new procedures,
that kind of thing.

727
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:10,844
‐ I've already got a job here.
‐ This is a side deal.

728
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:12,377
Only a few hours a week.

729
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,877
Can't be much pay.

730
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,910
It pays nothing.

731
00:29:14,944 --> 00:29:16,210
And the perks?

732
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:17,544
There aren't any.

733
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:19,910
No salary, no perks,
sounds great.

734
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:22,244
See ya.

735
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,377
Hell of a way
to get a job offer.

736
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,810
'And proceed
seven steps forward.'

737
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:35,644
'You have now reached
the admit desk..'

738
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:37,844
You already took
the audio tour.

739
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:40,744
Yeah, I know, but Dr. Doyle
doesn't know that.

740
00:29:40,777 --> 00:29:41,844
Bernard, you owe me.

741
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:44,777
Okay...okay.

742
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,744
How many times is he
gonna take that thing?

743
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:50,844
Hey, Carter's about
to do that pelvic.

744
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:56,377
We're going to take a look
inside with this speculum.

745
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,177
I need you to relax.

746
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,410
There's tissue at the Os.

747
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:12,710
Ring forceps.

748
00:30:16,777 --> 00:30:18,810
Ah.

749
00:30:18,844 --> 00:30:20,544
Let's get that to pathology.

750
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,444
I need to check
your ovaries now.

751
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:29,510
You tell me, uh..

752
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,610
...is there any pain here?

753
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:35,810
‐ Mm‐mm. No.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

754
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:38,744
How about here?

755
00:30:38,777 --> 00:30:40,344
Uh, no.

756
00:30:40,377 --> 00:30:43,277
Okay. No adnexal masses
or tenderness.

757
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,577
You can put your legs
back down, Mrs. Draper.

758
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,644
Mm, what is it?
What's going on?

759
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:54,777
I am very sorry, but you
have had a miscarriage.

760
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:00,610
You sure?

761
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,377
Mm‐hmm.

762
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,344
'The fetus was pushed
out of the womb.'

763
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,410
Your bleeding has slowed

764
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:11,277
but we need to observe you
for a little while.

765
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,710
I'm gonna come back.

766
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:15,377
And then I'm gonna
do another pelvic exam.

767
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,477
Make sure the bleeding
has stopped

768
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,444
and that, uh, the
cervix is closed.

769
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,210
A doctor from OB/GYN
is gonna stop by.

770
00:31:25,644 --> 00:31:27,777
Miss Knight, would you
stay here until they do?

771
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,444
Of course.

772
00:31:31,477 --> 00:31:33,310
Get some rest, Mrs. Draper.

773
00:31:33,844 --> 00:31:35,410
Rest. Huh!

774
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,310
I thought this time
it would be alright.

775
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:47,177
I never made it
to nine weeks before.

776
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,177
I don't know why
this is happening.

777
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,410
Why is this happening?

778
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,310
I don't know.

779
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:06,644
I'm sorry.

780
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,544
'I don't know.'

781
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:15,801
Bernard, what are you doing?

782
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,068
I have no idea.

783
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,568
‐ Miss Knight.
‐ Yes. Hi.

784
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:21,334
I just thought we could,
just, uh, excuse me a moment.

785
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:26,001
Jerry, I thought you were
gonna notifying the morgue

786
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:27,368
for a pick‐up.

787
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:30,201
I did. Sorry, Dr. Weaver,
I'll call them again.

788
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:32,934
So, I haven't had much of a
chance to work with you today.

789
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:34,268
I trust everything
is going well?

790
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:36,301
Yes. Pretty well
for a first day.

791
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,168
In other words, it's been
completely hateful, huh?

792
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:40,334
Kerry, I need to do
a needle aspiration

793
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,068
on a 15‐year‐old with a PTA.

794
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:44,001
I need the mother's consent if
you're available.

795
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:47,434
Yeah. Of course. Miss Knight was
looking for a case to observe.

796
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:50,234
The more the merrier. Come on.

797
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,934
'You see that, now, that's
a peritonsillar abscess.'

798
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:56,868
Large pocket of pus,
collected around the tonsils.

799
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,068
And we have to get
that fluid out of there.

800
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,068
We gonna numb it first

801
00:33:00,101 --> 00:33:03,501
and we're gonna use a needle
to draw out the infected fluid.

802
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:06,134
Now, an alternative is to
open the pocket with a scalpel

803
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:07,968
but that's more invasive.

804
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:09,868
The needle aspiration
should do fine.

805
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,468
‐ If you're sure?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

806
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,234
You've obviously
been a hit‐the‐books

807
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,268
kinda medical student.

808
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,901
Is there any other kind?

809
00:33:25,934 --> 00:33:28,968
Well, some are more
diligent than, say, I was.

810
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,934
You're a Pediatric
Emergency Fellow, right?

811
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,401
‐ Yep.
‐ Which is not an attending?

812
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:34,001
One rung under the boss.

813
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:37,134
So that's why you need
an attending to be a witness?

814
00:33:37,168 --> 00:33:39,301
I mean, when you have
parents sign a consent form

815
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,934
one of the attendings
needs to witness that.

816
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,901
I recently performed
a procedure

817
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:46,068
on a seven‐month‐old baby
who was born addicted to heroin.

818
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,401
I detoxed him. I didn't
get his mother's consent.

819
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,068
What happened?

820
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:51,401
Well, the powers that be
were a little upset.

821
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:54,434
So, I'm now
a Pediatric Emergency Fellow

822
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:55,901
on probation

823
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,301
and the baby isn't
addicted to drugs.

824
00:33:58,334 --> 00:34:00,301
Sometimes it's a trade‐off.

825
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:02,234
Good luck.

826
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:04,534
Every guy in that gym must
have thought I had a coronary.

827
00:34:04,568 --> 00:34:06,534
They were all over me
like white on rice.

828
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:09,168
Asking me if they could help,
get me some water.

829
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:12,001
One guy even offered
to take me to his own doctor.

830
00:34:12,034 --> 00:34:13,368
‐ Oh, that's very generous.
‐ Yeah.

831
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,801
'Miss Knight, what do we have?'

832
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:17,201
Roxanne Please, 25.
She was at the gym‐‐

833
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:20,901
You know, I dropped a darn
15‐pound weight on my toe.

834
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,234
I really hope it's not broken.

835
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,434
Jerry, what's open?

836
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:25,234
Uh, Curtain Area 1.

837
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:29,834
Or, uh, uh, maybe Exam 1
would be better.

838
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,901
Okay, we'll check it out
and get an x‐ray.

839
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:34,101
There's a woman looking for you.
A Mrs. Fernandez.

840
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:35,334
Firefighter's wife.

841
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,001
Oh, okay. We'll get
you in the Exam Room.

842
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,534
You know, I can, uh,
I can take care of that.

843
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:41,301
Okay, Jerry.
It is your birthday, so..

844
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:42,534
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

845
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:44,301
‐ Happy birthday.
‐ Oh, thank you.

846
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,268
‐ Mrs. Fernandez.
‐ Yes?

847
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:52,901
I'm Dr. Greene.
This is Miss Knight.

848
00:34:52,934 --> 00:34:54,101
Where is Emile?

849
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,501
We came as soon as we could.

850
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,301
The whole family,
we just piled in the car.

851
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,034
Ah, I think it would
probably be a good idea

852
00:34:59,068 --> 00:35:02,234
if the family stayed here
in the waiting room.

853
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:12,368
Mrs. Fernandez,
your husband fell 20‐feet

854
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,568
on to a concrete surface.

855
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,301
The paramedics were there
and they brought him right in.

856
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:19,868
There was no internal
abdominal bleeding

857
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,234
but the CT scan of his head

858
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:24,168
showed diffuse brain injury
and swelling.

859
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:26,801
What does that mean?
How serious?

860
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,968
He can't breathe on his own.

861
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,801
He's on a ventilator.

862
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,901
He can't move any muscles.

863
00:35:32,934 --> 00:35:35,034
He's not opening his eyes.

864
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:37,468
He's in a coma.

865
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,201
Well, does he need an operation?

866
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:43,468
Unfortunately,
there isn't any that can help.

867
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,301
The prognosis is not good.

868
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,168
We're going to
admit him to the ICU.

869
00:35:48,201 --> 00:35:50,534
Monitor the pressure
in his brain

870
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:53,501
and treat the swelling
the best we can.

871
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,501
Is he brain dead, Dr. Greene?

872
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,268
We're gonna have
to wait and see.

873
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:11,101
If the tests show no brain
activity over the next few days

874
00:36:12,968 --> 00:36:16,001
you're gonna have
to think about..

875
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:18,068
...continuing life support.

876
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:39,234
Lucy, can you
take Mrs. Fernandez

877
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,834
to see her husband?

878
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,468
Can he hear anything?

879
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:50,168
Uh, it's possible.

880
00:36:50,201 --> 00:36:52,868
It's...no way
to really know.

881
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:48,201
You can talk to him.

882
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,801
Do you have any idea
what you cut your foot on?

883
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:02,034
No, I was diving the Wellsburt.

884
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,068
It's a shipwreck
out in Lake Michigan.

885
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,801
Uh, when I felt a slice
across my foot.

886
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,501
What's weird, though,
at that depth

887
00:38:08,534 --> 00:38:10,001
the water filters
out all the red

888
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,301
so your blood comes
out looking green.

889
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:13,134
When was your last tetanus
shot, Mr. Reinhart?

890
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,968
I don't know. My mom used to
keep track of all that stuff.

891
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,868
Well, your laceration
is superficial.

892
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:19,468
'But it's gonna require
a few stitches.'

893
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:20,901
We'll give you a
dose of antibiotics

894
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:23,434
before we do
the sutures.

895
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,301
Miss Knight, do you think
you can handle the IV?

896
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,368
Of course.

897
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:29,468
'I'll be back.'

898
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:43,334
You do know how
to do this, right?

899
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,334
Yes.

900
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:52,568
Oh, uh, could I ask you
something for a second?

901
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,901
‐ Sure.
‐ Um.

902
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:56,368
It's just that this
is my first IV, and I‐‐

903
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,301
You don't wanna
punish the patient.

904
00:38:58,334 --> 00:39:00,168
‐ Something like that.
‐ Okay.

905
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:02,268
Thank you.

906
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,368
You wanna give it a try?

907
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,001
Oh, no,
I'll just watch this time.

908
00:39:05,034 --> 00:39:06,501
Alright.

909
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,401
First you're gonna
take the tourniquet.

910
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:11,768
And you're gonna tie it
into a slip knot...like that.

911
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:17,168
Miss Knight, films came back

912
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:18,968
on that woman
who dropped the weight.

913
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,768
Small non‐displaced fracture
of the proximal phalanx.

914
00:39:23,034 --> 00:39:25,034
Fifth toe.
Just do a buddy tape.

915
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:26,868
‐ A buddy tape?
‐ Uh‐huh.

916
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:29,968
Yeah, you tape the little toe
to the one next to it. Okay?

917
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,834
Tell her she can
expect some discomfort

918
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:32,968
for the next couple of weeks

919
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:34,968
and to wear hard‐soled shoes.

920
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,568
Okay.

921
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:38,401
When you look
at the actuarial tables

922
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,201
term is definitely
the way to go.

923
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:41,801
Hmm.

924
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,334
‐ Ms. Please.
‐ Oh, please, call me Roxanne.

925
00:39:44,368 --> 00:39:46,068
Been saying that
my whole life, haven't I?

926
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:49,001
Well, good news. It's just
a small hairline fracture.

927
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,401
Well, how long
will that take to heal?

928
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:51,901
A couple of weeks.

929
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,201
Um, I need to tape you up

930
00:39:53,234 --> 00:39:56,168
and you should wear
hard‐soled shoes.

931
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:58,801
‐ Roxanne sells insurance.
‐ Really?

932
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:01,834
Yup. Life, disability,
umbrella policies, you name it.

933
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,934
You, uh, you have insurance?

934
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,068
Just medical, through school.

935
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,934
‐ Oh!
‐ Sorry.

936
00:40:10,968 --> 00:40:12,234
You should start
your coverage now.

937
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:14,234
Your age, premiums
are incredibly low.

938
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:17,968
Roxanne says disability
is more important than life.

939
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,301
Yeah. Statistically
you're much more likely

940
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:23,201
to be maimed
or mutilated, than killed.

941
00:40:23,234 --> 00:40:25,368
Really? Who knew?

942
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:28,168
Roxanne's also staying
for the party.

943
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,401
What party?

944
00:40:29,434 --> 00:40:31,068
Jerry's surprise party.

945
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:32,368
He says they always have one.

946
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,768
Okay. There we go.

947
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:38,501
That should do it.

948
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:39,934
'Scuba man is on his way.'

949
00:40:39,968 --> 00:40:42,068
Only took a half
a dozen sutures.

950
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:46,801
By the way,
nice job on that IV.

951
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:48,234
Good.

952
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:51,434
No, seriously, I kinda threw
you in the deep end there.

953
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:53,834
I didn't think you'd
be able to do it.

954
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,501
‐ Good to know you can swim.
‐ Thanks.

955
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,534
‐ Can I see you for a minute?
‐ Sure.

956
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:01,868
Mrs. Fernandez is looking
for either you or Dr. Greene.

957
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,534
Okay.

958
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:07,168
Mrs. Fernandez, can I help you?

959
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:09,501
I‐I, I couldn't
stay in with Emile.

960
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:12,301
I‐I, I can't see
him that way.

961
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,934
I can't talk to him.

962
00:41:14,968 --> 00:41:17,068
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ You don't have to be sorry.

963
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:20,068
Look, I need
to take my children home.

964
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:22,868
Tell Dr. Greene that
I will come back tomorrow

965
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,934
and, and I guess we'll
talk about what to do.

966
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:28,168
Okay. Okay, I'll tell him.

967
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,234
'Jerry?'

968
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:38,301
'Jerry, get over here, please.'

969
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:40,168
I mean, wh‐wh‐what
does it take, huh?

970
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,434
I'm, I'm sorry.

971
00:41:41,468 --> 00:41:42,501
How many times
have I asked you

972
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,934
to get this body
to the morgue?

973
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,068
I will call them
again, Dr. Weaver.

974
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:46,834
No, you will not! No!

975
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,334
You will not
call them again.

976
00:41:48,368 --> 00:41:51,068
You will take this poor soul
over there yourself.

977
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:53,501
‐ Oh, Dr. Weaver, I'm not‐‐
‐ Jerry, it's just a corpse.

978
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,968
It's not like you've never
seen a dead body before.

980

Light the candles.
Somebody cut the cake.

985
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:25,034
‐ Alright. Thanks.
‐ Happy birthday, Jerry.

986
00:42:25,068 --> 00:42:26,568
Uh, I gotta go pick up Rachel,
get her some dinner.

987
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:28,268
Why don't you bring
her over to our house?

988
00:42:28,301 --> 00:42:30,001
‐ We're having a barbecue.
‐ Really? About an hour?

989
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:32,501
Yeah.

990
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,101
Maimed or mutilated, huh?

991
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,834
Yeah, I know it's not
a pretty picture, huh?

992
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:37,201
No, no, no, tell me more.

993
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,268
'I can't believe
they're having a party.'

994
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:39,834
It was such a horrible day.

995
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:41,834
Yeah, well, tomorrow's
gonna be even worse.

996
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:44,301
I just found out I got
assigned to Dr. Doyle.

997
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:46,901
‐ When did you hear that?
‐ Dr. Weaver told me.

998
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,968
‐ You're with Dr. Carter.
‐ Oh, man!

999
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,934
No, if I was you
I'd consider yourself lucky.

1000
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,168
He thinks I can swim.

1001
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:55,934
Well, at least we
survived day one.

1002
00:42:55,968 --> 00:42:57,401
Yeah, I was incredibly busy.

1003
00:42:57,434 --> 00:42:59,401
I basically did nothing,
and helped no one.

1004
00:42:59,434 --> 00:43:01,301
Well, at least you got
to see some patients.

1005
00:43:01,334 --> 00:43:04,368
Dr. Doyle won't let me
near a single one.

1006
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:05,934
Yeah, I saw some patients.

1007
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:07,901
Hey, you want a piece of cake?

1008
00:43:18,434 --> 00:43:20,434
'We love you, Jerry!'

1009
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,968
Mr. Fernandez?

1010
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:53,034
Emile?

1011
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:57,334
My name is Lucy. I work here.

1012
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:01,934
I met your wife.

1013
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:10,401
I know how much she loves you.

1014
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:13,001
And how much your kids love you.

1015
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:18,768
And how they wish
this hadn't happened to you.

1016
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:24,934
How we all wish
this hadn't happened to you.
