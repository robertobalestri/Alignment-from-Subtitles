1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:06,633
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:08,066
You don't need me
to tell you this

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,533
but it's okay for
you to miss him.

4
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:10,766
Hell, I miss him.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,433
It's possible that
he may need surgery.

6
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:15,800
Do you know what
happened to Mobalage?

7
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,066
He was tortured
in Nigeria, right?

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,100
Turns out Mr. Ikabo came into
the country on a forged visa.

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,033
‐ He's an illegal.
‐ Send him back to Nigeria?

10
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,033
The INS will start
a deportation hearing.

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,366
You'll need the dough
if you accept

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,133
the cardiothoracic
fellowship next year.

13
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,166
Making the decision to tracking
down your birth parents

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
is not something
you should do lightly.

15
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:34,033
You're what?

16
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm pregnant.

17
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,233
'Carol?'

18
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:50,433
'Doug?'

19
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,066
‐ Mom.
‐ Oh, you're still here.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,133
Huh?

21
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,600
I knocked before
I used my key.

22
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,566
I thought
you had left.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
What? I was just resting.

24
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,533
What time is it?

25
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,133
Um, 8:30.

26
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,133
Oh, man, I'm late.

27
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,266
Where's Doug?

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,566
He left.

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,366
I thought you
went in together.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,533
No. Not anymore.

31
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:15,333
I had extra holubtsi
from Evonne's shower.

32
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,233
'I know he likes it.'

33
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,033
Are you..

34
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:22,733
Are you alright?

35
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

36
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:26,166
I'm fine.

37
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,433
I don't know
how you stay healthy

38
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,500
working in that place.

39
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,166
Have you eaten?

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,333
I'm not hungry.

41
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,400
Call in sick.
I'll make you breakfast.

42
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,433
Ma, I've got to go.

43
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:38,400
'Lock up when you
leave, alright?'

44
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,166
‐ Carol?
‐ Yeah.

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,500
Are you sure you're okay?

46
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:44,033
I'm fine.

47
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,500
We'll talk later, alright?
I'll call you.

48
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,166
Why was it rescheduled anyway?

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,500
Oh, come on.
You're kidding. Reese.

50
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:54,300
Uh‐uh. Here. Here you go.

51
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,400
'No. I have an appointment
with the new school for Reese.'

52
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,600
The only have open house
once a month

53
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:00,166
and I've already
missed it twice.

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,533
Tell Romano you called
and I wasn't home.

55
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:07,733
Yeah. No. Hey.. Hello.
No, no, no. I don't want..

56
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:10,133
Dr. Romano.

57
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:13,400
No. Listen.
Uh, I'm off this morning.

58
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,600
The earliest I
can get there is noon.

59
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,133
Yeah, I know, but I can't..

60
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,133
Hold on. Hold on.

61
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,133
Reese, no! No, Reese!

62
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,066
This is no. No!

63
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,300
No!

64
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,733
That's no.

65
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,500
Hey, hey, here.
Take that.

66
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,200
Play with that.

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,766
Yeah. I'm sorry.

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
I have an important
appointment, okay?

69
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,666
I can't..

70
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:48,566
Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,166
Alright. I'll be there
in half an hour.

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,333
Jerk.

73
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,100
Reese!

74
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,033
No, Reese.
Not your hearing aid!

75
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,400
No, no, no!

76
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,333
Damn!

77
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:08,400
No, no, no.

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,666
Mr. Deluz, time for your meds.

79
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,800
'Need some help here.'

80
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,300
‐ Just a minute.
‐ No, now. I need O2.

81
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,400
We don't provide that here.

82
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:19,800
Well, then I‐I need some pillows

83
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,033
to help prop up her head
to help her breathe.

84
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:23,000
Of course.

85
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,033
She's really altered.
Is that her baseline?

86
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,233
No. Mrs. Brennan was
agitated this morning.

87
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,266
I've got a PRN
order for Haldol.

88
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,400
She's hypoxic. Have you
listened to her lungs?

89
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,233
That's not what
we do here.

90
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:37,400
We're strictly board and care.

91
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,033
You should have
called somebody.

92
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:41,366
Her lungs are wet,
and she's got pitting edema.

93
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,300
Dr. Davis increased her Lasix
from 40 to 80 milligrams.

94
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,033
And he hasn't
seen her since?

95
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:47,800
‐ No.
‐ We've got to push IV meds.

96
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,633
Look, I'm a LVN.

97
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,633
If you want I can arrange for
an RN to come out tomorrow.

98
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,800
Tomorrow? She's in
congestive heart failure.

99
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,233
You call 911.

100
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:57,366
‐ She's DNR.
‐ Call 911 now!

101
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,433
‐ You're not her doctor.
‐ No, I'm her daughter.

102
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,466
Group therapy
in your first week?

103
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
That's what my intern said.

104
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,033
God, all I did was observed

105
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,400
the my first two weeks
of psych rotation.

106
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,600
I believe he used
the words sink or swim.

107
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,233
I think, he's just
trying to scare you.

108
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:08,333
I'm not scared, I'm actually
really good at this stuff.

109
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,366
What's that?
Mental illness?

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Shut up.

111
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,033
‐ Sorry I'm late.
‐ That's okay.

112
00:05:12,066 --> 00:05:13,333
Now that you're
out of management

113
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,633
you can slack off
with the rest of us.

114
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,566
‐ Hey, Carol.
‐ Hi.

115
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,033
So, Carter,
where do you want me?

116
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,266
Oh, I don't know.
Let's see

117
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,366
why don't you
take the hematuria.

118
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,133
After your work‐up,
we'll discuss your plan.

119
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,333
Okey‐dokey.

120
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,600
Did I miss something?

121
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,400
Yeah, Carter is
senior for the day.

122
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,033
Part of your chief resident
application?

123
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,066
Yeah, something like that.

124
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,133
For the next eight hours

125
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,566
if you have a problem,
go to him.

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
‐ Peachy.
‐ Good luck.

127
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,300
Yeah, you, too.
Jerry, where are all the pens?

128
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,733
I don't know. Some idiot's idea
of an April fool's joke.

129
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:42,366
Well, listen, go down to supply
and steal a couple, would you?

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,533
I got you.

131
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,200
‐ 1.5 volts is pretty cool.
‐ Real mature.

132
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:50,766
Oh, come on, it's April fool's.

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,466
Jerry, I'd watch my back
if I were you.

134
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,433
I've got an anxious
hemorrhoids in four

135
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,266
and a kid with a high
fever in triage.

136
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,366
‐ Talk to Dr. Carter.
‐ 'Dr. Greene?'

137
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,633
‐ How did it go?
‐ We got a problem.

138
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,100
‐ Did you get my affidavit?
‐ Yeah, that's fine.

139
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:06,433
But I can only get
the continuance

140
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,666
for physical disability

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,300
if Mobalage remains
hospitalized.

142
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,600
Shouldn't be a problem.

143
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,400
Urology still has him
on the surgical service.

144
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,600
INS confirmed he was being
discharged this morning.

145
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,433
Where did you get that?

146
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:19,166
Uh, "Elizabeth Corday."

147
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,633
I thought you had an open house
or something?

148
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,200
Yeah, well, Weinstein
pushed up a lung resection.

149
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,133
Weinstein
the cardiothoracic guru?

150
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,133
Yeah, he got tickets to some
college baseball game

151
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,466
so Reese has to stay in day care
for another month.

152
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,066
Yeah. No, it was only in
there for a few seconds.

153
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,566
Uh, I just wanted to make sure
the water didn't damage it.

154
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,266
Reese's hearing aid.

155
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,100
‐ How much?
‐ Don't ask.

156
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,233
Okay, well, yeah.. I know, but
is there any way to test it?

157
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:45,533
Come on, Peter,
Weinstein's ready for us.

158
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,333
Yeah, hold on.
I know I can't‐‐

159
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,166
‐ Hey!
‐ I said, let's go.

160
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,100
‐ Don't ever do that.
‐ Are you deaf? I said let's go.

161
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,366
I heard you. I'm trying to fix
my son's hearing aid, okay?

162
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,500
One word, Peter.
Nanny.

163
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:01,200
I can think of a word
of my own.

164
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,133
Get out now, Elizabeth.

165
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,333
What do you mean?

166
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,700
In a few months,
you'll have your license

167
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,533
and your pick
of fifth‐year residencies.

168
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:09,066
Oh, it's alright,
I think I found a way

169
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
to limit my Romano exposure.

170
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,066
Oh, yeah. What's that?
Garlic?

171
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,533
Trauma surgery.

172
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:17,200
A fellowship run
out of the ER.

173
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:19,266
It would start in July.

174
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,400
I didn't know there
was a trauma fellowship.

175
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:22,766
Well, there wasn't.

176
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,266
Trauma is the reason
why I came

177
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,566
to the States
in the first place.

178
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,066
And the hours are better

179
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,333
and I'd have some
semblance of a normal life.

180
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,033
Uh, yeah, yeah,
we got disconnected.

181
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm the one
with the hearing aid..

182
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,300
Elizabeth?

183
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,566
Oh, Mark, I need
to speak to you.

184
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,300
Uh, the INS called
about Mobalage.

185
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,733
I know. Did you discharge him?

186
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,333
I didn't volunteer
any information

187
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:40,600
but I couldn't lie.

188
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:41,733
He was afebrile.

189
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:43,433
His wound was dry,
clean and intact.

190
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,800
‐ Did you discharge him?
‐ Yes.

191
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,333
When did he leave?

192
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,666
I don't know if transport's
taken him down yet.

193
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,433
Why? Is there a problem?

194
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,266
We're trying to get a physical
disability continuance.

195
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,033
On a pudendal
artery bypass?

196
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,400
As long as he
was hospitalized

197
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,200
we could avoid
a deportation hearing.

198
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,666
Now, he'll have to see
the judge.

199
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,133
Yeah, but one look at the scars

200
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,300
and the judge
will grant him asylum.

201
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,700
It doesn't work that way.

202
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,166
Mobalage has to testify,
describe the torture.

203
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,500
Isn't it obvious?

204
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,300
Apparently not
to the government.

205
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,500
They need a record,
a sworn statement.

206
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,733
What? And Mobalage
refuses to give it?

207
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't think he can.

208
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:17,700
After his nap, he
was a little upset.

209
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,133
I thought it
was a nightmare.

210
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,266
But he wouldn't
stop crying.

211
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,466
Temp's 101.

212
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,033
Now I can't
wake him up.

213
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:25,066
‐ Is he on any medications?
‐ No.

214
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,066
‐ Has he ever been hospitalized?
‐ Never. He's a healthy kid.

215
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,133
‐ He could be septic.
‐ What does that mean?

216
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,133
Well, we need to treat him
with antibiotics right away

217
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,466
'and then perform some tests'

218
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,233
'to find out the source
of the infection.'

219
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Jerry, is trauma one open?

220
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:41,233
Yeah. You're in early.

221
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,800
Ah, be right back.

222
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,233
Hey, who's this?

223
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,366
Critical patient.
Pulmonary edema.

224
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,433
I need a monitored bed.

225
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,566
BP's borderline at 95

226
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,033
after her fifth
nitro spray.

227
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:50,600
You guys are only supposed
to give three.

228
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,733
I gave it to her.

229
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:53,566
Oh, you doing a ride‐along?

230
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,400
Set up a nitro drip, hurry!

231
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:57,433
I don't want to intubate.

232
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,766
No extraordinary measures.

233
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,533
Board and care says
she's a DNR.

234
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,333
Set up BiPAP,
we'll go from there.

235
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,066
How's your
breathing, ma'am?

236
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,233
I'm, uh..
I'm, uh..

237
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,300
She's altered, Carter.

238
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,633
On my count,
one, two, three.

239
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,366
Gently.

240
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,133
Call upstairs,
see if we have a ICU bed.

241
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,066
Let's get some
admit labs.

242
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,666
Chest film,
EKG, blood gas.

243
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,233
BP's 100/75, resps 20.

244
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,666
Tachy at 130.

245
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,266
She's pretty gorked out.

246
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,600
‐ I can take it from here.
‐ Put in a Foley.

247
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,300
Where's my 12‐lead?

248
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,333
Yes, I'll take it
from here, Dr. Weaver.

249
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,566
This one's mine, Carter.

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,233
I'm senior for the day,
remember?

251
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:30,466
I'm running the big board.

252
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,333
So, go run it.

253
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,333
Okay.

254
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,700
Carol, where's the nitro?

255
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,533
Hold on. I just got to
clear an air bubble.

256
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:42,166
Okay, then give her another
sublingual spray, now.

257
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,366
Dr. Sadowinski is an expert
in these kind of cases, okay?

258
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,800
I just want you
to meet him.

259
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,500
But I've already talked
to your psychiatrist.

260
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,133
Yeah. But, talk to this one.

261
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,166
Mobalage, they will
send you back.

262
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,533
He's not been
through enough?

263
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,700
Kubby.

264
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,133
I don't understand
it either.

265
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm not an
immigration expert.

266
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,766
But I do know that
you telling your story

267
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,066
is the only way
that you can stay.

268
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,400
Let me just get you a little
time to think about it.

269
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll take you
down to the ER.

270
00:10:13,633 --> 00:10:16,433
You're feverish,
pulse is tachy.

271
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:17,733
If anybody asks you

272
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,100
you're experiencing
belly pain.

273
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,700
‐ Go.
‐ Okay.

274
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,200
'I never imagined frozen sperm
would be a good investment.'

275
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,033
'It's tricky.
You've got to buy the best.'

276
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,666
Good of you
to join us, Peter.

277
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,266
Sorry, I had to
rearrange my schedule.

278
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh, that's alright,
in another ten years

279
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,366
you get to
set the schedule.

280
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,700
So you only inseminate Arabians
or what?

281
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,533
No, thoroughbreds too.

282
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:44,266
Remind me,
I'll get you a brochure.

283
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,033
You like horses, Peter?

284
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:47,333
Yeah, yeah.

285
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,100
Yeah, neither did I.

286
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,466
But they got a big upside
once you know what you're doing.

287
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,700
You ought to
keep that in mind.

288
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,100
‐ Thanks.
‐ 'Dr. Weinstein.'

289
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,366
Your office is on the phone

290
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,233
a sales rep from
Symatac is waiting.

291
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:59,600
Oh, damn, I forgot.

292
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,533
This guy's going to comp me
a new thoracoscope.

293
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:05,466
Okay if we push this
back to 1:00?

294
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,466
Yeah, sure, no sweat.

295
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,466
Okay, I'll see
you then.

296
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,600
‐ End of shift?
‐ Oh, no, just started.

297
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,633
‐ You?
‐ Post call.

298
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,466
Six hours to go.

299
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,466
Feels like this internship's
never going to end.

300
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,033
It always feels
like that.

301
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,333
That looks really good.

302
00:11:31,366 --> 00:11:32,633
I'm famished.

303
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,566
I just can't eat
anything, you know?

304
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,166
I'm trying to keep
something down, but..

305
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,300
Here.

306
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,333
Thanks.

307
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,566
Morning sickness?

308
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,333
Yeah..

309
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,533
And I'm really,
really tired.

310
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:49,666
Have you seen your OB?

311
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,200
You've not made
a decision.

312
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,800
You know, three months ago,
I was worried

313
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,333
that I couldn't
even get pregnant

314
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:59,633
and now, here I am,
all alone.

315
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,066
I wanted to have
a baby with Doug.

316
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,666
I don't want to be
a single mother.

317
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,266
Well, do you have to be?

318
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,566
I mean, have you
spoken with Doug?

319
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:12,733
I see all these pregnant women
parading through here

320
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:16,033
lost, frightened,
not knowing what to do.

321
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,266
Okay, and what do
you tell them?

322
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
I always say,
go with your gut

323
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,300
'cause most of the time
it's right.

324
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,000
So, what does yours tell you?

325
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:26,433
I don't know.

326
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,266
'I need somebody
from surgery on board.'

327
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,800
You discharged Mobalage

328
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,366
so according to bounce‐back
rules, he's yours.

329
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,300
I know, but there's
nothing wrong with him.

330
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,633
Mmm, the incision looks
a little erythematous

331
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,366
around the sutures.

332
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,633
‐ Could be a wound infection.
‐ Mark..

333
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,566
I don't need you
to take him upstairs right away.

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,300
Just sign the readmit orders

335
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,366
and we'll observe him
down here in the ER.

336
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,200
You want me to
falsify his chart.

337
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,800
Just trying
to buy him some time.

338
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,400
His lawyer's already
on his way to see the judge

339
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,200
to tell him
he's being readmitted.

340
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,666
You're asking me to lie,
to sign my name to a lie.

341
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,533
I'm asking you
to help him.

342
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,500
Give it to me.

343
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,200
Thank you.

344
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,633
Hey, Mark, think I can get you
to see a couple patients?

345
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,800
In a second, Carter.

346
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,800
Jerry, did you steal
my stethoscope?

347
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,333
Nope. Haven't
seen it.

348
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:24,566
What makes you think
somebody gonna pick that one

349
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
out of all those pens?

350
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,800
'Cause it's shiny.

351
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,233
Malik, I need
postural vital signs

352
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,766
on bed three and..

353
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,600
You can discharge
Mr. Dudley.

354
00:13:33,633 --> 00:13:35,400
Come on, Jerry, I need it.

355
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:36,733
What makes you think
I took it?

356
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:38,766
‐ Aw, come on, man.
‐ Stealing stuff?

357
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,666
Where's the creativity
in that?

358
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,400
There has to be
a contact person

359
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,700
for the board and care.

360
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:46,433
No. Her fees are paid
for out of her pension.

361
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:47,600
Thank God you
found her.

362
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,733
She was totally
abandoned.

363
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,633
Sh‐she was going
to die there, alone.

364
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,033
I know, sometimes they're
gone before we find them.

365
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,733
Can you do a more
extensive search?

366
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,433
Find out where she's from,
any other children, maybe..

367
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:58,800
Maybe find my father?

368
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,200
Sure, I'll check it out.

369
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,433
Page me if you need anything.

370
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,100
Thanks.

371
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,300
Is that you, Claire?

372
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,333
No, my name is Kerry.

373
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,300
You were
having trouble breathing

374
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,400
so we had to bring you
to the hospital.

375
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,066
Hospital?

376
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,333
Now, don't worry.

377
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,266
We're gonna take very good
care of you, I promise.

378
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,266
Oh.

379
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,466
Ativan's on board, but
he's still tachycardiac.

380
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,333
Okay, let's add a blood
and urine tox screen.

381
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,633
Could he have
ingested anything?

382
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,366
Uh, something
from the medicine cabinet maybe?

383
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,566
No. I don't think so.
I thought it was an infection.

384
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,100
Pupils is dilated

385
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,166
you don't usually
get that with meningitis.

386
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
BP's up to 170/90.

387
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,133
'Anything, um..'

388
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,066
Cold medicine,
nicotine, bug spray?

389
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,166
All that stuff's put away.

390
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Your house is childproofed?

391
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,633
No.

392
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,200
I‐I only have him
every so often.

393
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,533
He sleeps in my room.

394
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,033
Oh, my God.

395
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,100
‐ What?
‐ No. T‐the drawer was closed.

396
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,300
What was in it?

397
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,366
Sir, there are
different treatments

398
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,666
for different toxins.

399
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,266
If I don't know what he ingested
he could die.

400
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,466
It was only, like,
half a gram.

401
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,033
Half a gram of what?

402
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,400
Cocaine?

403
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,800
Get Dr. Greene.

404
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,200
NG tube, activated charcoal.
Start IV Esmolol

405
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,700
'50 mics per kilo
per minute.'

406
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,100
'Sir, you might want
to wait outside.'

407
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,233
No, I want to
be with him.

408
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,400
This is going
to be messy.

409
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,633
That's alright.

410
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,033

No. I need an ICU bed, yeah.

427
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah, she needs
aggressive diuresis.

428
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,566
I thought a beta blockade
would do it.

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,466
She is not stable enough
for telemetry.

430
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,266
It was a good
pickup, though.

431
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,366
Hey, Dr. Weaver,
did you hear about this one?

432
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,700
Guy leaves his cocaine

433
00:16:25,733 --> 00:16:27,400
where his 3‐year‐old
can find it.

434
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:28,433
Did you call DCFS?

435
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:30,066
Oh! What the hell?

436
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
‐ Jerry.
‐ Jerry.

437
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,733
Dr. Greene..

438
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:34,400
Mobalage is asking
for you.

439
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,133
Is Dr. Sadowinski here?

440
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,733
Yes, but Mobalage
wants you there.

441
00:16:37,766 --> 00:16:38,766
He trusts you.

442
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,366
Red‐blanket baby on the way.

443
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,366
Some schizophrenic delivered
in the street.

444
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,533
Carter, you got it?

445
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,366
Uh, sure, yeah.

446
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,100
Give me a hand?

447
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,766
'I don't know.'

448
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,233
'There was a hood over my face.'

449
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,666
Were you frightened?

450
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,500
I thought I was
about to die.

451
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,566
Then what?

452
00:17:16,366 --> 00:17:18,932
They took you to a cell.

453
00:17:18,966 --> 00:17:20,599
Yes.

454
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,732
What kind of cell?

455
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,499
It was cold.

456
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:32,232
What did it look like?

457
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:39,666
I don't know, sir.

458
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:41,732
They kept the hood
on your head?

459
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,499
Yes.

460
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,799
'Then what?'

461
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,632
'They came and got you?'

462
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,232
'How long
before they came back?'

463
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:11,632
'Mobalage, what happened next?'

464
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:16,699
I cannot tell you.

465
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,366
'Why?'

466
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,266
'Cause I do not remember.

467
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,566
My baby.
Where's my baby?

468
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,566
She's in the middle of the
street holding the newborn baby.

469
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,266
It was still wet
with amniotic fluid.

470
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:35,599
BP's 140/90.

471
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:36,832
How much blood loss?

472
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,732
Uh, about a pad
since we found her.

473
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:40,499
Start an IV, call OB.

474
00:18:40,532 --> 00:18:42,566
Okay, good breath sounds.

475
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,399
No. No. Where‐where's my..

476
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:45,799
How did she cut
her forehead?

477
00:18:45,832 --> 00:18:47,499
She must have fallen
on the sidewalk.

478
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:48,632
Did they find
the placenta?

479
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,932
She said a dog ate it.

480
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:52,266
Okay. Irrigate
this scalp lac.

481
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,966
Get me a speculum
I'll do a pelvic.

482
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,266
Oh, hey, please,
please, please

483
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:58,899
Where is my
baby? Where?

484
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:00,699
I'll go check on him
right now, alright?

485
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:01,832
Okay?

486
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,332
Let's give her
five of Haldol IM.

487
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:04,899
I'll be right back.

488
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,732
How's the mother?

489
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:10,332
She needs her head sutured
and I'm giving her Haldol.

490
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:11,532
'How's it going?'

491
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,899
Mottled and lethargic
initially

492
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:14,299
but we're warming him up.

493
00:19:14,332 --> 00:19:15,899
Good color. Good tone.
Pulse 140.

494
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,432
'Looks full term.'

495
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,766
'What is that?'

496
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,299
'Is that a garbage tie?'

497
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:22,199
At least she knew
to clamp it off.

498
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:24,199
Give me an umbilical clamp
and some betadine.

499
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:25,466
You gonna do
a heel stick?

500
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,466
Yeah. Where are
the 22‐butterflies?

501
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,232
Try the pedes room.

502
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,966
Okay, let's get a newborn
screen and a cap gas.

503
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,832
She stole my baby.

504
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,466
Give him back to me.

505
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,366
Honey, you have to go
back in and lie down.

506
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,599
‐ No.
‐ Haleh, call security.

507
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:43,299
You can't have him.
He's mine.

508
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:45,466
Yeah, we're just
taking care of him.

509
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,366
‐ Can I hold him?
‐ Not right now.

510
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,899
We're going back
in the other room.

511
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,799
We're going to stitch up
that cut on your forehead

512
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,866
and then you can come
back in and see him

513
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,699
‐ I promise, alright?
‐ I love my baby.

514
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,666
‐ I know.
‐ I love my baby.

515
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:57,866
It's okay.

516
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,232
No!

517
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:03,766
Give him back to me!
Give him to me!

518
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,799
Coco, you have
to let go now.

519
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:06,332
No, can't have him.
He's mine!

520
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,599
‐ Let go, Coco..
‐ No. No.

521
00:20:08,632 --> 00:20:09,866
Help!

522
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:11,499
No! No! He's my baby!

523
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:12,966
‐ Out. Get her out.
‐ Come on. Come on.

524
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:15,632
No! He's my baby!

525
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,366
You.. No!

526
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:19,232
You cannot have him!

527
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,766
'He's mine!'

528
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,866
‐ Take it easy.
‐ No!

529
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:24,299
No!

530
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:25,532
Any signs of trauma?

531
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,266
No. He seems okay.

532
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,399
'Are you okay?'

533
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,799
Yeah.

534
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,299
Okay, sweetie.

535
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:42,932
Hey, Kerry,
you got a minute?

536
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,266
If you want
to walk with me.

537
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:46,766
Hey, listen I was wondering,
what are we going to do

538
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,966
with our sternal
saw study?

539
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,399
Well, as soon as I finish

540
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:51,399
compiling the data
I'll pass it on to you.

541
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:52,732
You know, I was thinking

542
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,766
maybe we should
write a paper together.

543
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,232
Oh, I assumed

544
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:56,932
you'd want to write
yours separately.

545
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:58,366
Why would you think that?

546
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,232
Different specialties,
different journals.

547
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,299
Come on. It was a joint study.
It should be a joint paper.

548
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:03,666
I think it's better
suited

549
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,199
for an emergency medicine
journal anyway.

550
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:06,399
Sure. Peter,
that would be great.

551
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,932
Okay, I'll call you.

552
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,366
Hey, Kerry, you know,
I heard that there might be

553
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,966
a surgical trauma fellowship
run out of the ER.

554
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:15,499
Did Romano tell you that?

555
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,899
No. Why?

556
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,666
Uh, confidentially

557
00:21:18,699 --> 00:21:20,466
we're trying to
go around him.

558
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,766
Oh. Yeah, well,
that makes sense.

559
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,699
So, is it an open
application process?

560
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,632
Anspaugh's taking it
to the board next week.

561
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,832
Are you interested?

562
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,199
Um, I don't..
I might be, yeah.

563
00:21:30,232 --> 00:21:31,532
Okay, I'll let you know.

564
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:33,199
Thanks.

565
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:34,299
'You said he had
to stay admitted.'

566
00:21:34,332 --> 00:21:35,599
‐ I had him readmitted.
‐ I know.

567
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:36,966
But the judge suspects
we're stalling.

568
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,466
‐ Which we are.
‐ I'll talk to the judge.

569
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,832
It wouldn't matter.

570
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,366
Government prosecutors
are coming tomorrow

571
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,499
to take a deposition.

572
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:43,766
Off that, the court
will review

573
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,266
and make its decision.

574
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,366
He won't be able
to tell them anything.

575
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,599
If he wants to stay in the
country, he'll have to.

576
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:52,299
‐ He doesn't remember.
‐ Anything?

577
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:54,266
The abduction,
not the torture.

578
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,899
They must have seen
post‐traumatic stress before.

579
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,666
People claim it
all the time.

580
00:21:58,699 --> 00:21:59,832
That's the problem.

581
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:01,466
We have physical evidence.

582
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,766
Look, I'm not arguing
their position.

583
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,832
I'm simply telling you
what the reality is.

584
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,499
Without a sworn statement

585
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:08,899
specific to the torture,
it can go either way.

586
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,499
How's the baby doin'?

587
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,766
Blood glucose is good
up to 68.

588
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,599
He's in the nursery
eating like a champ.

589
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,599
Good. How we
doing in here?

590
00:22:18,632 --> 00:22:20,466
She's throwing PVCs.

591
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,332
Don't worry.
She's gorked out.

592
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,766
‐ How long?
‐ What?

593
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,332
Has she been
throwing PVCs?

594
00:22:25,366 --> 00:22:26,532
I don't know.
I just took it down.

595
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:27,932
Well, you should have
called me.

596
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,399
She's DNR.

597
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,799
I'm working on an
ICU bed for her.

598
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:33,732
Did her family change
their mind?

599
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,199
No. There isn't any family.

600
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:38,266
Oh, well, that makes it easier.

601
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,932
Less complicated.

602
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,599
Jerry, why is that frequent
flyer still in four?

603
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:56,932
Uh, he's waiting on a cab.

604
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,899
For 55 minutes?
Come on, I need the bed.

605
00:22:58,932 --> 00:23:00,232
Carter, Dr. Greene told
me to talk to you.

606
00:23:00,266 --> 00:23:01,399
Make it fast.

607
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,599
Time clock's broken.
I can't punch in.

608
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,332
Call administration.

609
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:06,566
I did. But they said I can't
start working until they fix it.

610
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,299
Note the time
on the back of the card.

611
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:09,466
They won't let us do that.
They think we gonna cheat.

612
00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:10,699
Just clock in
upstairs then.

613
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:12,766
I can't.
A different system.

614
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,632
Uh‐huh! Nice try.
April fool's?

615
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,599
‐ You blew it.
‐ Sorry. He was getting mad.

616
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,232
Chuny, I thought
better of you.

617
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:20,432
Malik put me up to it.
I swear.

618
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:21,599
Yeah, blame the brother.

619
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:23,599
‐ Here, have a pen.
‐ Thanks.

620
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:25,532
‐ You wanted to see me?
‐ What's the deal with CT?

621
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,499
I got three patients upstairs
in a holding pattern.

622
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,666
Crashed on us.
Computer guy's working on it.

623
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,932
‐ How long?
‐ Four hours.

624
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,299
Four hours?
You serious?

625
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:34,766
Have you known me
not to be serious?

626
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,699
Okay, Jerry, that's it.

627
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:38,299
We're closed
to neuro trauma.

628
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,399
Uh, I'll call Weaver.

629
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:40,632
No, don't call Weaver.

630
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,365
I'm senior for the day.

631
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,032
CT's down, closed to neuro.

632
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:45,199
Whatever you say, boss.

633
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:46,732
We got another one.

634
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:48,299
Four‐month‐old female,
high fever, cough.

635
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,499
Okay, I'll be right there.

636
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:50,899
Sam, don't go anywhere.

637
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:52,999
I may need a wet read
on a chest film.

638
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,717
What are you doing?

639
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:56,317
We need to massage
your uterus

640
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,650
to help shrink it.

641
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:01,317
It closes off
all the blood vessels?

642
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,150
That's right.

643
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:06,650
I read that.

644
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:08,817
I'm sorry.

645
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,750
I didn't mean
to attack you.

646
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,684
I‐I get crazy
without my meds.

647
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:17,584
I understand.

648
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,650
How's my baby?

649
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:23,217
He's doing great.
He's in the nursery

650
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,017
and they're taking
good care of him.

651
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,184
But he's healthy, right?

652
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:28,250
There's nothing wrong with him?

653
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:29,884
No, no, no. He's perfect.

654
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:36,150
I went.. I went off the drugs
for the pregnancy.

655
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,717
I know.

656
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,017
I didn't want them
to hurt him.

657
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,317
I know.

658
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,217
I thought about it.
I knew what I was doing.

659
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,284
I knew I was taking a risk.

660
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,150
That I couldn't get out
of control

661
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:52,617
end up on the street,
but it worked.

662
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,150
I made it.

663
00:24:54,184 --> 00:24:57,717
You got lucky,
but it's not over.

664
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,384
I can go back home.

665
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,017
I'll stay on the medication.

666
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,250
I know that I have to.

667
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:04,950
Not for me, for him.

668
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,750
Coco, we're
not talking

669
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,684
about a month
or six months or a year.

670
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:09,950
You can't ever stop.

671
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:13,317
I won't. I love him already.

672
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,950
I loved just the idea of him.

673
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,317
That's all that really
matters, right?

674
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:27,317
They'll let me keep him,
won't they?

675
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,284
‐ We'll see.
‐ No, no!

676
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:31,117
They can't take him
away from me.

677
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,150
‐ Please, please.
‐ You need to rest.

678
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:37,017
Hi, my name is Lucy Knight.

679
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,784
I'm a student doctor.
How are you feeling?

680
00:25:45,017 --> 00:25:47,384
Michael, stop it.
Be still.

681
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,650
You want a fourth tube.

682
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:49,884
Might as well.

683
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,317
Fluid looks
pretty clear, though.

684
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,850
‐ That's good?
‐ Yes.

685
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,084
If it's a really
bad infection

686
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,950
the fluid can be
kind of cloudy.

687
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:59,184
We'll still need to send
these tubes to the lab though.

688
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:02,317
Michael!

689
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,717
You got a second?

690
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,650
Yeah. Be with you
in one minute.

691
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:06,984
Hold him still.

692
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:11,017
Okay, I'll be right back.

693
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,717
Gram stain and culture in one.

694
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,350
Glucose and protein in two
and cell count in three.

695
00:26:16,384 --> 00:26:18,950
‐ What do we got?
‐ You tell me.

696
00:26:21,184 --> 00:26:23,850
What's wrong
with this picture?

697
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:27,217
Uh.. Those rib fractures?

698
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,684
Four. One, two,
three, four.

699
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,050
Any signs of abuse?

700
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:34,684
I didn't see
any ecchymosis.

701
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:36,850
Bruises heal on infants
pretty quickly.

702
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:41,084
Huh.

703
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:43,084
‐ Chuny?
‐ 'Yeah.'

704
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:44,384
Can you get DCFS
on the phone

705
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,850
and call security
to curtain two?

706
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,250
I want a full bone survey

707
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:48,917
skull series, long
bones, the works.

708
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,184
Let's take them now
before the inquisition.

709
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:54,884
Mrs. Leason, there's
a little problem

710
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,650
with the chest X‐ray.

711
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,817
‐ What kind of problem?
‐ Nothing to be alarmed about.

712
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,317
Just a little fuzzy.
She might have been moving.

713
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,050
But we need
to try again.

714
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,050
Can I go with her?

715
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,717
It's actually better
if you stay here.

716
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,650
I said stop it!

717
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:11,184
Your sister is sick!

718
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:14,217
Mrs. Leason, take it easy.

719
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,850
I'm fine.

720
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,350
What's this?

721
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,984
We discovered
some old fractures

722
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,050
that looked like they may be
the result of some trauma.

723
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:25,317
What?

724
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,750
By law, I'm required
to report them.

725
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:30,217
I thought you said
the X‐ray was fuzzy.

726
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,084
We need to document
a complete set.

727
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,284
Document what?

728
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:36,350
How did Michael break his arm?

729
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,250
He fell off the bed.

730
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,884
A representative

731
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:42,950
of the department of child
and family services

732
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:44,217
is going to come
and talk to you.

733
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,084
The hell they will.

734
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,384
‐ I'm leaving.
‐ Not with your children.

735
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,850
I brought my baby to you
because she is sick.

736
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:52,717
And now you want
to take my children?

737
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,050
She doesn't leave
with this one.

738
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:55,384
Make sure she doesn't
go near radiology.

739
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,684
I'll call the police.

740
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,317
You go ahead,
you call the police!

741
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,784
'Cause you don't know
what you're talking about!

742
00:27:59,817 --> 00:28:00,950
You cannot do this!

743
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:02,317
‐ Yes, I can.
‐ No, you can't.

744
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:06,884
'They let Mobalage live'

745
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,884
'for people to
see him broken.'

746
00:28:08,917 --> 00:28:11,050
To set an example.

747
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:13,284
Why? What did he do?

748
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,750
He wrote a short story.

749
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,917
They saw it as
a call for revolution.

750
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,650
Was it?

751
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,317
I didn't know
he was a writer.

752
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:30,250
He's an engineer, but
he was a romantic to me.

753
00:28:30,284 --> 00:28:31,817
Not as you see him today.

754
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,684
He was warm and funny.

755
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,017
Energetic.

756
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,250
Kubby, I need to know things
about the torture.

757
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:43,684
Anything that could help
spark his memory.

758
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,350
We don't speak of it.

759
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:48,017
You must know the sort of things
that they did.

760
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,084
You can see the sort
of things they did.

761
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:58,017
I was thinking more of where?
How long? When? Details.

762
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,384
I cannot give you details.

763
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,617
I wish I could.

764
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,917
When will we have to go?

765
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,250
Your visa's valid.

766
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:11,784
It's only Mobalage.

767
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,317
When will we have to go?

768
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:18,684
I don't know.

769
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,250
Thank you.

770
00:29:23,284 --> 00:29:25,084
For what?

771
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,017
You've been very kind.

772
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,384
I want to help him.

773
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,117
So do I.

774
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:36,650
‐ Hey, Kerry.
‐ Hey.

775
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,817
I was checking vitals
on Mrs. Brennan.

776
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,050
Chart says you pushed
some lidocaine.

777
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,717
That's right.

778
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,084
Did her DNR
status change?

779
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:44,617
Do Not Resuscitate

780
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,350
does not mean,
Do Not Treat.

781
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,850
You treated
an arrhythmia.

782
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:49,817
Yeah, that's
not resuscitation.

783
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,650
So you won't intubate?

784
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,850
Carol, she's my patient
and I'll make a judgment call

785
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:55,184
if it comes to that.
Excuse me.

786
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,284
A judgment call?

787
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:58,684
Isn't that a little
hypocritical?

788
00:29:58,717 --> 00:30:00,017
What?

789
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,250
Doug made judgment calls

790
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:02,717
what he thought was best
for his patients.

791
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,684
Carol, Doug created
his own problems.

792
00:30:04,717 --> 00:30:06,017
You didn't help much.

793
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,850
Is that what you think?

794
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:09,984
Is that what you think,
that I drove him out of here?

795
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,984
No. But I know you
wanted him out.

796
00:30:12,017 --> 00:30:14,317
Oh.. I am not gonna have
this conversation with you.

797
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,084
At least, he never
went against his patient.

798
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:18,050
‐ No, this is different.
‐ How, Kerry?

799
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:19,817
‐ How is this different?
‐ She is my mother.

800
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,117
Mrs. Brennan..

801
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,084
Mrs. Brennan is my mother.

802
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,717
Why didn't
you tell me?

803
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,817
I don't know.

804
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,217
I was adopted.

805
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,950
And I hired..

806
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:39,884
I hired this private detective
to find her.

807
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:42,084
I never imagined
it would happen like this.

808
00:30:42,117 --> 00:30:43,384
I..

809
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:46,284
I didn't expect
to find an old woman.

810
00:30:47,717 --> 00:30:49,350
I always thought
that she was probably

811
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:52,184
some scared teenager
who couldn't keep me.

812
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,617
I..

813
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,017
I thought that I
would have more time

814
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:02,717
have some kind of meaningful
conversation, ask her questions.

815
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,150
But the minute I find her,
she's dying.

816
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:09,217
Kerry, I'm so sorry.

817
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,850
It's not your problem.

818
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:13,784
She's Hemoccult positive.
Crit's down.

819
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,717
I'm going to call
for a GI consult

820
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,850
Type and cross‐match
two units, okay?

821
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:31,184
You know your way around
a resection, Peter.

822
00:31:31,217 --> 00:31:32,850
But do a little more
homework next time.

823
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:35,050
Ah, we keep him pretty busy.
Want to get coffee?

824
00:31:35,084 --> 00:31:37,184
No, thanks. If I leave now,
I can make the third inning.

825
00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:38,684
Always a pleasure,
gentlemen.

826
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:40,217
You bet. Take care.

827
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,717
See you later. You jerk.
Don't worry about that.

828
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,717
I didn't even know
the answer to that question.

829
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,384
No.. I should be
more prepared.

830
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:48,317
Ah, go home.
See your munchkin.

831
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,950
His name is Reese.

832
00:31:49,984 --> 00:31:52,684
Oh, like Reese's
pieces, cute.

833
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,617
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

834
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,984
How'd it go?

835
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:58,284
Oh, fine, I guess.

836
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,684
Not exciting
enough for you?

837
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:03,817
No, it was...interesting.

838
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,950
So why did you feel the need
to poach my meager ambitions?

839
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:10,617
What?

840
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,117
I spoke with Kerry Weaver
about the status

841
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,817
of the trauma fellowship.

842
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,950
She told me there might
be a selection committee.

843
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:18,084
That there was
other interest.

844
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:20,217
Was that you?

845
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,784
I mentioned something.

846
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,150
Peter, I told you
in confidence.

847
00:32:26,184 --> 00:32:28,117
I wouldn't have said anything
if I thought for a second

848
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,284
you'd try and
steal it from me.

849
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:32,150
It's already yours?

850
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:33,884
It was my idea.

851
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:35,750
I brought it to
Greene and Weaver.

852
00:32:35,784 --> 00:32:37,850
Okay, well, I'm sorry,
you didn't tell me that.

853
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,184
Peter.

854
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,250
Look, I didn't say I wanted it.

855
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:42,750
I was just asking.

856
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:43,784
Oh, well, then.

857
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:44,984
Let me know when
you decide.

858
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:46,950
I'll go ahead and
plan my life.

859
00:32:46,984 --> 00:32:49,917
Elizabeth,
it's not like that.

860
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,350
You know, it's just that..

861
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,984
I don't know, you know, things
aren't working out right now.

862
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,850
I don't like cardiothoracic.

863
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:58,750
Oh, what?
So trauma's a backup?

864
00:32:58,784 --> 00:33:01,650
No. I just thought that this
might make sense, you know?

865
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:03,084
I can't spend the
next five years

866
00:33:03,117 --> 00:33:04,250
being some kind of
indentured servant.

867
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,850
I‐I need time for Reese.

868
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,184
‐ Oh, now that's low.
‐ What?

869
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:09,817
Well, I know you
love your son

870
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,050
but don't use him as
an excuse to screw me over.

871
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:13,617
You know what? Take it.

872
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,250
I don't want it.
I'll find somethin' else.

873
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,084
No! I don't want you
to forfeit it to me!

874
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:19,117
If you want it, by all means,
you go for it.

875
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:21,217
I'll still get it.

876
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,284
How are those
films coming?

877
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,117
Come in. You're gonna
want to see this.

878
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,384
Whose is this?

879
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,217
I don't know.
It's been here all day.

880
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,850
I've been looking
everywhere for this.

881
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,850
28 different
fractures total.

882
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,850
Not all calcified.

883
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:42,984
Bilateral humerus,
left femur..

884
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:45,850
Right tib‐fib, linear
involvement of the skull.

885
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:47,384
Geez, what did she
do to this kid?

886
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,884
We should get a head CT.

887
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,184
There's some pleural
scarring.

888
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:53,150
Possibly a spontaneously
healed pneumothorax.

889
00:33:53,184 --> 00:33:54,917
Wait a minute. What is this?

890
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,717
Non‐displaced fracture
of the eighth rib.

891
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,750
I thought, uh..

892
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,050
There were only
four rib fractures.

893
00:34:00,084 --> 00:34:02,817
There's five here.
You sure this is hers?

894
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:05,850
‐ Yeah, I took a whole new set.
‐ Where's the old one?

895
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,317
‐ Same technique?
‐ Yeah.

896
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,850
So where's the fifth fracture?

897
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:20,050
There isn't one.

898
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:22,017
What, it happened in the ER?

899
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,217
Did you press on her chest?

900
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,750
I held her down
to do the LP.

901
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:27,717
Could be osteogenesis
imperfecta.

902
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,084
Uh.. I did it?

903
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:30,250
Their bones break
like glass.

904
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,817
Oh, man..

905
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,717
Oh, man.. I went
right to abuse.

906
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,817
I didn't even..
I didn't even think about OI.

907
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,317
Did you already call
social services?

908
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,684
Yeah, cops are down there
talking to the mother right now.

909
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:41,884
Well.. Honest mistake.

910
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,717
Better to be safe, right?

911
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,817
Yeah, how do I go from
sorry I accused you

912
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,750
to your daughter's got
a terrible disease?

913
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:50,250
'You should put
on a jacket.'

914
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:51,650
It's still a little
nippy out here.

915
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:52,884
Yeah. I'm ready for spring.

916
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,217
I got your page
in the car

917
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,917
I figured I'd just
swing by, how is she?

918
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,284
Uh.. She's dying.

919
00:34:59,984 --> 00:35:03,684
I got some preliminary
info for you. Wanna hear?

920
00:35:03,717 --> 00:35:05,784
Cathy Brennan, she was a
stewardess back in the day

921
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:07,217
they called them
stewardesses.

922
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,317
Uh, married late, two
years after having you.

923
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,950
Not to your father.
I'm still working on that.

924
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,250
Divorced six years later.

925
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:15,250
One child, a daughter, Claire.

926
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,617
Died in a car accident
in her mid‐twenties.

927
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,184
Are you okay?

928
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:24,717
Did you know that
her blood type was O positive?

929
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,884
We don't usually get
that kind of information.

930
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:28,150
Yeah, I had to type
her blood

931
00:35:28,184 --> 00:35:30,150
because I was going
to put her in the ICU.

932
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,050
She.. She didn't want that.

933
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,917
But somehow I thought
I had the right.

934
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,250
That's a natural reaction.

935
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:36,784
I'm AB.

936
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:40,650
it's impossible for
that woman to be my mother.

937
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:42,950
‐ Are you sure?
‐ It's basic hematology.

938
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:44,217
A plus B equals AB.

939
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,750
There's no O in the equation.

940
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,250
I'll call my guy in the
County Clerk's Office.

941
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:49,950
He, uh, stole a peek
at the file.

942
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:52,250
He must have rushed,
read it wrong.

943
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,250
You should be more careful.

944
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:57,150
The information is there,
I can get it.

945
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,650
You're not going
to quit, are you?

946
00:35:58,684 --> 00:36:00,050
It's my fault.

947
00:36:00,084 --> 00:36:01,317
You shouldn't let it
undermine your resolve.

948
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,050
You're fired.

949
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,350
‐ 'Hey, Carter.'
‐ Hi.

950
00:36:05,384 --> 00:36:06,717
How many patients
do you have?

951
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,117
One. I finally got
a good case.

952
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,017
A paranoid schizophrenic
had a baby.

953
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,284
Yeah, I know.
I was there.

954
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:12,817
Oh, great.
How's senior for a day?

955
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:13,984
Not over yet.

956
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,884
‐ Lucy.
‐ Yeah?

957
00:36:15,917 --> 00:36:17,917
Have you called your
resident about Coco yet?

958
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,350
Uh, no, I have
to complete

959
00:36:19,384 --> 00:36:21,284
a comprehensive
mental status exam.

960
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:22,950
I'm presenting her
at chief rounds.

961
00:36:22,984 --> 00:36:26,684
Well, you need to call
your resident, now!

962
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,317
Why? Is something wrong?

963
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,084
Look, Coco's had
over 12 admissions.

964
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:32,084
She's dealt with a lot of
different psychiatrists.

965
00:36:32,117 --> 00:36:33,317
I bet.

966
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,884
She feels you're
too inexperienced.

967
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:38,084
A schizophrenic thinks
I'm not qualified?

968
00:36:38,117 --> 00:36:40,650
Well, she's asked
for someone else.

969
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:42,050
Can she do that?

970
00:36:42,084 --> 00:36:44,050
She's got a lot at stake,
Lucy, you know?

971
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,817
She's worried.
Just call your resident.

972
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,984
Hey, Dr. Greene.

973
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:55,084
Can I ask you somethin'?

974
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:57,184
Sure, Jerry.

975
00:36:57,217 --> 00:37:00,184
What does it mean if
your piss turns blue?

976
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,817
Just out of curiosity?

977
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,684
My piss is blue.
Dark blue.

978
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:08,817
Somebody got you.

979
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,984
Oh, man.

980
00:37:11,017 --> 00:37:13,117
How could they change
my bodily fluids?

981
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,750
Have you eaten anything that
you didn't make yourself today?

982
00:37:15,784 --> 00:37:17,250
Brownies in the lounge.

983
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:18,817
Mmm.

984
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:22,094
Oh, man,
it's not toxic, is it?

985
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:24,094
It's probably methylene blue.

986
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:25,761
Let me know
if it starts burning.

987
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:27,028
Burning?

988
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,728
I'm just kidding, Jerry.

989
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,028
You'll be fine.

990
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:33,261
Well, how long am I
going to pee like this?

991
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,394
Mmm, day or two.

992
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:38,361
Eh, someone's going to pay.

993
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:40,394
Told you to watch your back.

994
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,694
You're here.

995
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:41,761
You came back.

996
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:43,661
That's right.

997
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:47,994
Claire?

998
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,994
Claire?

999
00:38:53,828 --> 00:38:55,094
Yes.

1000
00:38:57,761 --> 00:38:59,628
I love you.

1001
00:39:03,194 --> 00:39:05,394
I love you, too, mom.

1002
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:18,061
It's okay.

1003
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,761
It's a bathroom.

1004
00:39:25,794 --> 00:39:27,694
Yeah, it's just
a bathroom.

1005
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:29,094
Three stalls..

1006
00:39:29,128 --> 00:39:30,394
Urinals..

1007
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:33,994
Couple of sinks.

1008
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:36,094
But for a long time..

1009
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:38,661
I had trouble
even coming in here.

1010
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:45,761
I used to dream about it.

1011
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:47,794
It was my nightmare.

1012
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,828
I was standing right
here at the sink.

1013
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:55,261
Someone had just left.

1014
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,828
I was washing my face.

1015
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:01,894
Suddenly, I feel a pain
shooting through my skull

1016
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:03,728
and I realize

1017
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:05,894
that my head has
hit the porcelain

1018
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:10,094
as I'm crashing
into the mirror.

1019
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:14,661
My mind is one step behind.

1020
00:40:16,328 --> 00:40:18,028
Someone's attacking me.

1021
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:23,728
I end up on
the ground here..

1022
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:27,194
...and he's gone.

1023
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:31,061
So I crawl out..

1024
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:34,894
...and I try to stand up
and he's on me again

1025
00:40:34,928 --> 00:40:39,361
and he's kicking and punching
and kicking

1026
00:40:39,394 --> 00:40:42,994
and this sharp pain
shoots through my hand

1027
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:46,828
as he stomps on it.

1028
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,428
I can still feel it.

1029
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:53,361
I'm lying there
in the middle of the floor..

1030
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:57,828
I can't stand..

1031
00:40:57,861 --> 00:40:59,761
I can't talk..

1032
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,394
I just keep thinkin'..

1033
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,994
...why didn't I do anything?

1034
00:41:07,794 --> 00:41:10,728
'Why didn't I fight back?'

1035
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,294
You cannot fight back.

1036
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:20,894
You cannot move.

1037
00:41:30,061 --> 00:41:33,361
There's no window there.

1038
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:42,161
Only a bright light
in that corner.

1039
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:47,394
Someone lies over there.

1040
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:53,128
You know him.

1041
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:55,161
A friend.

1042
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,361
He's dead.

1043
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:05,761
There are voices..

1044
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:10,328
A scream from over there.

1045
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:16,028
A chain..

1046
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:22,261
You hang from a chain
right here.

1047
00:42:23,728 --> 00:42:25,828
Right here.

1048
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:31,928
There is laughter.

1049
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:40,694
A fire over there.

1050
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,961
They heat the long blade.

1051
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:47,861
Oh..

1052
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:51,061
Hold it to you,
it burns.

1053
00:42:52,694 --> 00:42:54,828
You cannot breathe.

1054
00:42:55,861 --> 00:42:58,028
It comes again, harder.

1055
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:02,261
Longer.

1056
00:43:02,294 --> 00:43:04,228
'You smell it.'

1057
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:07,728
You smell your
own flesh burning.

1058
00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:14,928
Death.

1059
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:19,061
I wish for death.

1060
00:43:20,794 --> 00:43:23,294
But my wife..

1061
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:27,894
...my family.

1062
00:43:29,294 --> 00:43:31,661
My family..

1063
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:56,161
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi. Can I help you?

1064
00:43:56,194 --> 00:43:58,094
Yeah, I was hoping
to catch Dr. McLucas.

1065
00:43:58,128 --> 00:43:59,928
She left for the day.
We are closing up.

1066
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:01,128
Are you a patient?

1067
00:44:01,161 --> 00:44:02,194
Yes. Carol Hathaway.

1068
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:03,694
Is it an emergency?

1069
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:06,028
No, um.. I just need
to see her.

1070
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:07,428
Uh, can I make an appointment?

1071
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,194
'Sure. What's it for?'

1072
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:11,661
I'm going to have a baby.
