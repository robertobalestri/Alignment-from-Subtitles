1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,233
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,300
So, four candidates
including me.

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,766
Actually...you make it five.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,533
This hearing aid's expensive
when I just found out

5
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:15,300
that my insurance won't cover.

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,733
I said that we share everything
and I meant everything, okay?

7
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,366
I practice my IVS
on a mannequin.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,166
That's good. But know
when to ask for help.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
I want you to toast the
new pedes ER attending, me.

10
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,566
I have heard of
foreign doctors

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,666
who were willing to
start over as interns.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,600
If they amputate,
is it certain I'll live?

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,766
It looks like it's stopped
like two and a half blocks.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,033
‐ Should we hoof it?
‐ I don't know.

15
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,666
Aren't you supposed
to be setting policy?

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,066
I'm here for
the ride‐along.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,600
‐ I hate one‐way streets.
‐ This is nothing.

18
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,166
I once responded
to a cell phone call

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
from the middle of
a Metallica concert.

20
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:03,266
Try getting an anaphylactic
head banger past 10,000 maniacs.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,066
Guy dropped some acid,
started him counting crows.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,366
I have to live with
this every day.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,800
You got any pull
with crew assignments?

24
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,266
Hey, hey, hey.

25
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,433
Hey, but if you do,
can you get us assigned

26
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,033
to the med team
at the Bears' game?

27
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,133
Look, I don't do
the scheduling, guys.

28
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,400
Too bad, you were almost
my new best friend.

29
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:19,300
Make way!

30
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,066
Hey! Paramedics
coming through!

31
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
Hey, hey! Stand back!
Stand back! Hey, hey.

32
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,400
Give us some room.
Give us some room.

33
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:25,533
Looks like a single..

34
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,700
Whoa, whoa, jeez!

35
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,100
‐ It's Cujo!
‐ No, no.

36
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,600
He's just
protecting his owner.

37
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,033
‐ Okay, you open the door.
‐ Sir, can you hear me?

38
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,166
‐ Is he breathing?
‐ His chest is moving.

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Got any ideas?

40
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,233
Oh, you're asking me?

41
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:38,433
Unit 57 to OCD, over.

42
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,133
A little puppy valium?

43
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,200
We need animal control
at fourth and orchid.

44
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,266
We've got dog barring access
to an MVA victim, over.

45
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,100
It'll take too long.
Look at this.

46
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,333
He's right.
We got to get in there.

47
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,800
'What do you suggest?'

48
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,600
‐ I got a gun in the rig.
‐ I'll keep him busy.

49
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,633
'You're kidding, right?'

50
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,566
We've got to assess him now.

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,200
'You're the boss.'

52
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,366
Hey, boy.
Hey, hey, hey, ready?

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,200
One...two...three! Hey!

54
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:03,466
Got a pulse.

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,100
Good breath sounds.
Get a backboard.

56
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,300
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah, I just can't let go.

57
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:07,300
When was your last
tetanus shot?

58
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,533
‐ 1992.
‐ Haleh?

59
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:10,800
One booster coming right up.

60
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,333
That's okay. I'll pass.

61
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,200
It could be worse.
You could have rabies.

62
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,733
Yeah, I wouldn't
rule it out.

63
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,633
Think we'd notice
a difference?

64
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,700
So, how many
interviews today?

65
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,566
Two. You and one other.

66
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,766
Yeah, you know,
I'm still interested

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,266
but I decided not
to push so hard.

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,466
I mean, if I get it,
you know, I get it.

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,266
‐ Good idea.
‐ What do you mean?

70
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,066
I mean, you know,
it's just not a good idea

71
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,566
to get worked up
over these things.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,433
‐ Hey, what happened to you?
‐ Ugh, long story.

73
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,500
‐ Rachel's sleepover?
‐ Good guess.

74
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:41,533
‐ Thanks, Kerry.
‐ What's going on here?

75
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,800
Graffiti guys got loose,
went crazy last night.

76
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,700
‐ Yeah?
‐ You're on?

77
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,533
No, I'm just getting set
up for tomorrow.

78
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:49,233
Color‐coordinated
charts?

79
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,800
Well, whoever said
Doug Ross isn't organized?

80
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,266
‐ I did.
‐ Take it easy.

81
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,666
Hey, um, Mark, don't attendings
pay for nurses night?

82
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,533
Yeah, now Doug
can contribute.

83
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,333
No, that's the ER.
I'm the pedes ER.

84
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,700
Yeah, well, pedes needs nurses,
right? So I'm billing.

85
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,066
Hey, get this.

86
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,200
19‐year‐old,
third pregnancy

87
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,333
says she doesn't know
how to use a condom.

88
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:11,366
So, did you teach her?

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,700
Oh, no, we're
way past that.

90
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm talking her
into a newer plan.

91
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,466
Are you sure?

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,266
I'd tie her tubes
myself, if I could.

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
I don't know, if
the drawbridge is up

94
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,666
you can't storm the castle.

95
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,733
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Try a diaphragm. They work.

96
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,666
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't be too
sure. I'm three days late.

97
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,300
Mm‐hmm.

98
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,466
What? What?

99
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,800
These just came from upstairs.

100
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,633
‐ Letters of rec for chief.
‐ Thank you.

101
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,466
Okay, lift your sleeve.

102
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,733
When was the last time someone
got tetanus from a dog bite?

103
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,233
Don't be a baby.

104
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:38,333
‐ Nice suit, Dr. Weaver.
‐ Thank you.

105
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,733
I didn't know
you read "Cosmo."

106
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:41,100
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Ow!

107
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,266
Last month's article
on the power suit?

108
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,666
Oh, uh, I guess
I missed that one.

109
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,533
Oh, are you sure,
'cause, I mean

110
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:51,366
you nailed it down
to the accessories.

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,033
So how long
have you been on?

112
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,166
Oh, just now.

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,466
Yeah? Who's your resident?

114
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,600
Oh, well I suppose
I'll find out in a minute.

115
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,633
Why? Did you vie for me?

116
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,600
You're too much
for me to handle.

117
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,500
Hopefully, whoever I get
feels the same way.

118
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:10,633
No, I suspect I'll be
sidelined as a consultant

119
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,800
more than anything else.

120
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,133
Yeah.
Hey, do me a favor.

121
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,166
Reach in his bag
and hand me his hearing aid.

122
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,033
It's in the black
case, on top.

123
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,433
Is he having trouble
with these?

124
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,133
No.

125
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,333
So why are you
putting them on now?

126
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,200
I was running late.

127
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:28,400
Peter, have you
not told everyone?

128
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:30,266
Told who?

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,133
Look, Elizabeth, I don't
have time for a whole bunch

130
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,666
of a repetitive questions
and‐and‐and sympathy.

131
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,233
You sure that's it?

132
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,266
My son is deaf.
I know that, okay?

133
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,066
Okay. Okay.

134
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,500
Well, wish me luck.

135
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,633
Jeff Whitcher, 38‐year‐old
magician, inhaled flash powder.

136
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,133
What happened?

137
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,600
Trap door didn't open.

138
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:53,166
A little more
complicated than that.

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Short of breath
and tachypneic.

140
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,700
Uh, respiratory
rate is 28.

141
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,100
No previous history
of respiratory illness

142
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,333
or inhalation of
toxic substances.

143
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,533
What's in flash powder?

144
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,100
Sorry. Trade secret.

145
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,366
Lycopodium wrapped
with potassium nitrate.

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,133
I looked it up
on the internet.

147
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,166
Pulse ox is
borderline 91.

148
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,266
No cyanosis.

149
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,400
‐ You a smoker?
‐ Occasional.

150
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:18,200
Yeah. Occupational hazard.

151
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,366
You can't smoke
that here.

152
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,366
Wasn't planning to.

153
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:24,166
What do you want to do?

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,266
Get a blood gas
and check a PO‐2.

155
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,266
Looks like you get
to learn a new procedure.

156
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,666
I just happen to have
a blood gas kit right here.

157
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
Hey, pretty good, doc.

158
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,233
Trade secret.

159
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:34,533
Lily, can you get
us a cup of ice?

160
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:35,733
‐ Sure.
‐ Please.

161
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,533
We're out of gloves.
I'll be right back.

162
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,766
Try your pocket.

163
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,600
Hey, how'd you do that?
He's got your arm.

164
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,333
It's not what they see..

165
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,600
...it's what they
think they see.

166
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,666
But you didn't
even move.

167
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,766
‐ Lucy?
‐ Yes.

168
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
A blood gas.

169
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:52,766
This one you watch,
next one you do.

170
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,666
Don't panic, Doug.
It's just a couple of days.

171
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,366
Honey, you said three days.
You said three.

172
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Two, three, whatever.

173
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,133
You told me you were
regular as a Swiss watch.

174
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,233
Yeah, I'm regular,
not a machine.

175
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:04,233
Are you going to do
a pregnancy test, or..?

176
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:05,266
You're really
sweating this.

177
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,633
I may. Aren't you, a little?

178
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,366
I'm not pregnant.
I don't feel it.

179
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,633
Have you been
pregnant before?

180
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,033
Oh, I shouldn't
have said anything.

181
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:16,600
'What's up? What happened?'

182
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,333
‐ Syncope. Fourth episode.
‐ Seizure?

183
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,033
I don't think so.
I thought you weren't on today.

184
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,666
I'm not. You wanna use
the pedes room, no waiting.

185
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
‐ Okay.
‐ Here we go.

186
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,200
Hey, what's this?
What's this? Hey!

187
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,433
Could be Carter's.
They were backed up today.

188
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,100
Carter! Is this
your body in here?

189
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:31,766
Yeah, sorry. Transport's taking
forever. You need the room?

190
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,133
'Yeah, I need the room.'

191
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,400
Give me a hand?

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,700
I didn't even think the pedes ER
was open until tomorrow.

193
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,500
It's not. Just don't leave
your stiffs in here.

194
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,533
Lucy, take him in the morgue.

195
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:42,566
You know, we've been waiting

196
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,300
on a transfer
for three hours.

197
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,233
‐ Hey, this The Prince Albert?
‐ Who?

198
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,466
You know, his
ding‐dong's pierced.

199
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
He's supposed
to have a diamond.

200
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,166
A diamond in his penis?

201
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,700
Haleh said, it was tricky
getting in the Foley.

202
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:54,033
‐ Want to take a peek?
‐ That's okay. I've seen one.

203
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,533
‐ I bet.
‐ Hey, watch it.

204
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,666
I guess it's your lucky day.
It seems I'm your intern.

205
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,400
‐ I know. You missed rounds.
‐ Oh, it's the first day.

206
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,566
I wasn't exactly sure
how this was going to work.

207
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
You need to be here
at 5:00 A. M. sharp.

208
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,266
I hope you don't expect
any special treatment.

209
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,666
Look, I don't know
what you've been told

210
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,400
but this is more of a
formality than anything else.

211
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:18,066
Maybe for you, but you're
the only intern I have.

212
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,166
I need you to finish
pre‐rounding before 6:00.

213
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,400
I need all the vitals.

214
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,700
T‐max, mental status,
I's and O's.

215
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,500
After rounds, check the labs
and run down all X‐rays.

216
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,700
Go over the X‐rays yourself.

217
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,433
Don't trust the radiologist.

218
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,300
Buff the electrolytes
as needed.

219
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,466
You take all floor calls.

220
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,033
If we have clinic that day,
you do H&Ps.

221
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,400
And of course,
all pre‐op orders

222
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:41,500
CBC, lytes,
UA, EKG, PT.

223
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,033
I do know how to pre‐op
a patient, thank you.

224
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,500
Well, good, because
if surgery's canceled

225
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,766
because you miss a lab,
it's your ass.

226
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
We'll start with
Mr. Anderson.

227
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,433
I reduced his O‐2.

228
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:54,233
Redraw an ABG
in 30 minutes.

229
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:58,100
Monitor urine
output Q one hour.

230
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,133
Advance drains on beds
three and five.

231
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,033
One, two and six need
wet‐to‐dry dressing changes.

232
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,600
You're serious.

233
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:06,033
This is how it works.

234
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,366
As third year,
I'm busy operating.

235
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,466
This stuff
is not my job.

236
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,800
But the scut
has to be done..

237
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,066
...by an intern.

238
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,400
I have three cases today.

239
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,766
If you finish,
you can scrub in for one.

240
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,633
Oh, and this is for you.

241
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,300
Interns wear short coats.

242
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,733
'Hold the elevator!'

243
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,033
'Hold it!'

244
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,066
You alright?

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,400
‐ I said hold the elevator.
‐ Oh.

246
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,333
'What was he wearing?'

247
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:51,666
‐ I don't know.
‐ Where are we?

248
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,166
We got a multiple defensive
stab wounds

249
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
to the extremities.

250
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,066
One to the forearm
and one to the chest.

251
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
BP's 120/75. Pulse ox 99.

252
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,166
Did the guy have
friends with him?

253
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,500
Both lungs
are clear.

254
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,600
Four plus right radial
and ulnar pulses.

255
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,733
‐ What's your name?
‐ Bo.

256
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:07,466
Bo, we're going to take care
of you, don't worry.

257
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,800
Yeah, you're very lucky.

258
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,433
The chest wound
is superficial.

259
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,466
Okay, Bo, I want you
to do this with your hand.

260
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,366
How about a car, Bo?
Did you see a car?

261
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,533
Okay, now spread your fingers
and don't let me close them.

262
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,533
Alright, I'm tired of this game.
Just tell me who it was.

263
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:22,166
‐ Does he have to be here?
‐ Why don't you wait outside?

264
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,466
'He was stabbed
in broad daylight.'

265
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,233
You're telling me,
you didn't see anything?

266
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:28,033
You know what?
Wait outside.

267
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,733
Okay, let's roll him.

268
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,266
He's gonna go out and try
and settle this on his own.

269
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,033
Right now we have
to treat him.

270
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,333
You know what?
Forget it.

271
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,533
Have it your way.

272
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:40,500
'You could have pressed
that hold button.'

273
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,733
Damn, these
elevators are slow.

274
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm going to catch
that lunch traffic.

275
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,133
I know it!

276
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,166
‐ You drive?
‐ A lot.

277
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,700
My son used to have
one of those.

278
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,633
Gave him a heart attack.

279
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,766
Nothing but stress.

280
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,633
Come on. Come on.

281
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,633
No, I didn't watch
the whole thing

282
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,066
but the part I saw
looked pretty benign.

283
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,300
It was my fault. Sorry.

284
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,633
‐ Well, you did. Thanks.
‐ Problem?

285
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,133
Did you know that
"Romeo and Juliet"

286
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,566
is rated PG‐13?

287
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,266
‐ I wasn't aware of it, no.
‐ Well, it is.

288
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,566
And I showed it
at Rachel's slumber party

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,266
and now all the mothers
are calling me.

290
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh, yeah.

291
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,433
'Elizabeth?'

292
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:31,266
'Elizabeth!'

293
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,666
Can you come take a look
at a pulseless foot?

294
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,300
I've been waiting 40 minutes
for a surgical consult.

295
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,033
Normally, I would, but as of
today, I'm only an intern.

296
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah, I heard about that.
I couldn't believe it.

297
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,700
I don't want
to believe it myself.

298
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,600
I already have
five admissions.

299
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,200
Lab turnaround time
is pathetic.

300
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,266
And radiology have already
lost three of my films.

301
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,233
Meanwhile, Dale has me
sitting for a bleeding time

302
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,133
on your Ewing's
sarcoma amputation

303
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,566
which is a complete
waste of time.

304
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,033
Amputation. You're talking
about Dana Ellis?

305
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,500
Yes. She doesn't have
a clotting problem.

306
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,600
‐ Is that today?
‐ Yes.

307
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,166
Surgery's scheduled
for 4:00 P. M.

308
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,166
Five minutes.
54‐year‐old male.

309
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Peripheral vascular disease,
cath pain at rest.

310
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm thinking
arterial thrombosis.

311
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,666
‐ Did you get a Doppler pulse?
‐ Yeah.

312
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,500
Mr. Darcy, this is Dr. Corday,
our surgical resident.

313
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,100
Look, how long will this
keep me out of commission?

314
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,633
I'm supposed to choreograph
a music video next week.

315
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,200
Well, let me examine you first
and I'll have a clearer idea.

316
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,600
Are you a smoker?

317
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,366
Yes, but what has that
got to do with my leg?

318
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,700
This the vascular consult?

319
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,300
'Yeah. I asked
Dr. Corday to examine.'

320
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,633
I'll take over.

321
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,400
Did you get the labs on
the prefed diverticulum?

322
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,033
Not ready yet.
They're backed up.

323
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:29,366
Better go down there
and sit on them.

324
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You know Romano.
Got to start on time.

325
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,033
Of course.

326
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,533
Come on.

327
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,100
‐ Lucy?
‐ What?

328
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,566
‐ Is something wrong?
‐ Nope.

329
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,033
Can you work up this guy
with vertigo for me?

330
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,200
You know how to check

331
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:51,200
for nystagmus
and cerebellar function?

332
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,100
Yeah? Alright.

333
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,600
Come find me when you're done.
We'll discuss the differential.

334
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,333
Got it.

335
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,700
What's the extension
for the morgue?

336
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,133
5001.

337
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,166
See this guy?

338
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,366
He's looking
for Dr. Carter.

339
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,266
Can I help you?

340
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,533
Yeah. My brother
died last night.

341
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:13,433
They gave me his valuables
but there's something missing.

342
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,033
I need to get a..

343
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:16,300
Well, some jewelry
off his body.

344
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,400
Oh, right. Right.

345
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,400
Oh, your brother's
down in the morgue.

346
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,133
‐ Last name Naughton?
‐ Yes, yes.

347
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,500
Definitely
down in the morgue.

348
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:25,766
Oh...can you tell me
how to get there?

349
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,233
Yeah. No.

350
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,500
Uh, they don't allow
family down there.

351
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,266
It's, uh..

352
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,533
They make you wait.

353
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:36,200
It takes forever.
It's chilly.

354
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,733
You know what, you know
what I'm gonna do?

355
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,333
I'm gonna go down there and I'm
gonna get it. Your brother.

356
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:43,566
Get your brother and bring your
brother back up here for you.

357
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,300
Great. That'd be great.
Thank you.

358
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,333
Don't mention it.

359
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,766
‐ Hey.
‐ What are you doing here?

360
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,766
Just came in to
check in on you.

361
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,633
How you feeling?

362
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,033
Well, they're
chopping my leg off.

363
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,366
Yeah.
Your decision?

364
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,133
You could
call it that.

365
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,666
I wouldn't have had a say
at all if it wasn't for you.

366
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,300
Got to go
with the odds, right?

367
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,066
You scared?

368
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,266
I thought, "Okay, I'll just
get used to it."

369
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,366
But..

370
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,666
You in pain?

371
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,266
‐ A little.
‐ Yeah.

372
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,566
Okay, I'll talk to them
and increase your dosage.

373
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,100
That's okay.
I sort of..

374
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,366
...like to feel it.

375
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,233
It'll be gone in a few hours.

376
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,133
‐ Hi, Mr. Ellis.'
‐ What's going on here?

377
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
Just came in
to check in on Dana.

378
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,533
She's being taken
care of, thank you.

379
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,366
Mm‐hm.

380
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Listen, I wanted
to talk to you

381
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,700
about her
pain management.

382
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,600
Dana's having surgery
in a few hours.

383
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,366
If you don't mind,
Dr. Romano is gonna

384
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,400
handle everything from here.

385
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:53,166
Okay.

386
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,733
Excuse me. Are you
in charge of transport?

387
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,766
Depends who's asking.

388
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
I know this is gonna
sound really weird.

389
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:06,433
But I was just wondering if you,
by any chance, found a body.

390
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,033
Transport.

391
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:11,533
Yeah, what floor?

392
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,566
Okay.

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,733
I don't know. Half hour.

394
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,733
Damn!

395
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,700
‐ What did you want?
‐ I lost a body.

396
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,600
Right. Did you try
to move it yourself?

397
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,133
Well, yeah, you guys
were taking too long.

398
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,166
What was I supposed to do?

399
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
So now it's our fault.

400
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,700
No, it's not your fault.

401
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,300
‐ I just want to find the body.
‐ I'll call the morgue.

402
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,800
No, I already checked
the morgue, he's not there.

403
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,300
Yo, Gerald!

404
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,300
Yo, it's Tony.

405
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,666
You have any unclaimed
bodies down there?

406
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Yeah, she's here now.

407
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,500
Hold on, I'll ask.

408
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,766
Would this body fit down
the incinerator chute?

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,633
The incinerator?

410
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,233
Yeah, that got her.

411
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:51,600
Yo, thanks, G.

412
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,733
Okay, I'll be right down.
You're in luck.

413
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:56,600
Someone stuffed some fat stiff
in the closet of the ICU.

414
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:01,200
Why? Why do you
have to go?

415
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,233
I just got to.

416
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,400
Well, what's the hurry?

417
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,566
Doctor said, it was okay.

418
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,800
Well, it will be okay.

419
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,500
He has to stitch it up first.

420
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,233
Besides, I like having
you around.

421
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:14,500
There's not very many
interesting people here today.

422
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,633
So, maybe...I'll come back.

423
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,100
Come on, you've got
to help me out.

424
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,700
You don't want to get me
in trouble, do you?

425
00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,500
I'll write you a note.

426
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:27,166
Besides, you do not want to get
that infected, believe me.

427
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Look, just a few minutes.

428
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:32,133
I'll get a doctor,
we'll take care of it.

429
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,200
‐ Alright.
‐ Good.

430
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,666
‐ Hey, Lynette.
‐ Yeah.

431
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,166
Could you get this
boy's mother for me?

432
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,500
Oh. He's 18.

433
00:16:42,533 --> 00:16:44,300
Yeah, but he's a gangbanger,
got stabbed.

434
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,666
I'm afraid he's gonna bolt
to settle the score.

435
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,766
‐ Mark.
‐ Yeah, hold on a minute.

436
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,433
You admitting
that thrombosis?

437
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,233
He's got a high‐grade lesion
in the femoral artery.

438
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:52,633
I know. You taking him up?

439
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,033
Well, I need to present
him to Romano

440
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,233
and then we'll bring
down the whole team.

441
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:56,666
‐ When?
‐ As soon as I can.

442
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,266
Mark, can you
stitch up my guy?

443
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
‐ He's getting antsy.
‐ I'll be right there.

444
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,600
Look, Jeanie, can you
clear this neck for me?

445
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,633
He looks okay.
Single vehicle MVA.

446
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,366
‐ I ordered a trauma panel.
‐ Sure, you got it.

447
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,733
‐ Thank you.
‐ Sure.

448
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:08,800
How we doing in here?

449
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,133
Vitals are normal.

450
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,466
I'm fine.

451
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Did you lose consciousness,
Mr. Lipson?

452
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,533
No. Listen, I told them
this really wasn't necessary.

453
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,166
‐ Any chest or abdominal pain?
‐ Can I go home?

454
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,733
No. We need to get an X‐ray
of your neck first.

455
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:22,766
Have you ever had hepatitis?

456
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,233
I don't think so. Why?

457
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,766
Your eyes
are a little yellow.

458
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,266
On any medication?

459
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,666
Prednisone, cyclosporine,
Imuran.

460
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,466
Those are
transplant meds.

461
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,433
Well, I had a new liver two
years ago.

462
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,733
Okay. Let's get a pro‐time LFTs
and a cyclosporine level.

463
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,266
Something's wrong?

464
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,500
Doctor, doctor,
por favor venga.

465
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:42,100
Just one minute.
You're jaundiced.

466
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,466
We need to do those tests now.
Okay? I'll be back.

467
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,166
Okay, just..

468
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,066
‐ 'Here you go, Jeanie.'
‐ Thanks.

469
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:04,893
‐ Um, this‐this is your card.
‐ Rosa Munoz.

470
00:18:04,926 --> 00:18:06,882
Si. That's social‐social
security card.

471
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:09,351
She said her
name was Carmen.

472
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:10,851
Rosa Carmen, si.

473
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:12,313
And your name?

474
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:13,380
Luisa.

475
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:14,663
Her sister?

476
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:16,196
Um, cousins.

477
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,230
Okay. I understand
that you're concerned

478
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,796
for Angel's health,
but this would be fraud.

479
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,714
It doesn't matter
if he's illegal.

480
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:23,148
Oh, no, no, no.
That's her number.

481
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:24,848
‐ No, this is your card.
‐ No.

482
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,581
Um..

483
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:31,881
...she say that he need
a special doctor?

484
00:18:31,914 --> 00:18:34,541
A cardiologist. There could be
a problem with Angel's heart.

485
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,974
Please take this number.

486
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,607
Please. Other hospital
no take him‐‐

487
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:39,874
Mrs. Munoz,
we're a county hospital.

488
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,441
We treat all emergencies.

489
00:18:41,474 --> 00:18:43,407
‐ True?
‐ True.

490
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,041
Sometimes when we're
short on beds

491
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:47,174
we stick the bodies
in the storage room.

492
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,941
‐ Why didn't you call us?
‐ We did.

493
00:18:48,974 --> 00:18:50,274
You guys, I got to get back.

494
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,241
Well, do you want to take
him back or should I?

495
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:54,874
He's black.

496
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:56,941
That a problem?

497
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,574
Dana Ellis, what about her?

498
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:00,874
Well, I'm worried
about phantom limb pain.

499
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,574
‐ Don't be. She's on morphine.
‐ That's not gonna do it.

500
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,174
I wanna put her on
a preemptive analgesia

501
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:05,407
to rewire the motor nerves.

502
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:09,241
I didn't realize
she was still your patient.

503
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,507
Dr. Romano, Dr. Greene
is on line three from the ER.

504
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,307
Waiting on a consult
on an ischemic leg.

505
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,141
Does he have
a pulse by Doppler?

506
00:19:15,174 --> 00:19:17,341
‐ I'll check.
‐ It's a simple lumbar epidural.

507
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:18,907
It's only gonna have to put
the surgery off a few days.

508
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:20,507
Look, I hate to be
the one to tell you

509
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:23,641
but one night course does not a
pain management specialist make.

510
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:25,374
Yes, the patient
has a Doppler pulse.

511
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,374
‐ Dr. Greene wants an ETA.
‐ When I get there.

512
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,074
There's no reason
not to try it, alright?

513
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:30,474
I‐I don't know that

514
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:32,141
she's psychologically
ready for the surgery.

515
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:33,941
Three days isn't gonna make
much difference with that.

516
00:19:33,974 --> 00:19:36,007
Hey, Dale, how's that
new intern working out?

517
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,041
She'll get the hang of it.

518
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:38,307
Why don't you give her a break?

519
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:39,374
Let her scrub in
on this prefed tic.

520
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:41,074
Hey, no, you're not. Hey!

521
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:43,007
That girl has a tumor in her
leg, cancer that could spread

522
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,607
very rapidly and I'm not
gonna sit idly by and watch you

523
00:19:45,641 --> 00:19:48,074
experiment with some technique
you just read about last week.

524
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,041
‐ Dr. Romano?
‐ What!

525
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:51,507
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Greene.

526
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,207
He wants something
more definitive.

527
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:55,141
If the guy's got calf pain,
tell him to do an ultrasound.

528
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,041
Hey, don't go anywhere.
And rule out DVT.

529
00:19:57,074 --> 00:19:58,107
That'll shut him up for a while.

530
00:19:58,141 --> 00:19:59,841
Leave it alone, Ross!

531
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:04,141
Hey, Carol, I have to head
upstairs to this interview.

532
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:06,274
Will you page me
the second Romano decides

533
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:07,374
to grace us
with his presence?

534
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,874
Hey, don't hold your breath.

535
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,241
Hold still.
You'll tear your stitches.

536
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:12,007
Let me out of here,
I got to go.

537
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,041
Why? Why? So you can take care
of the guy that did this to you?

538
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,341
‐ Hey, what's going on?
‐ You were right.

539
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:17,107
Bo here wants to retaliate.

540
00:20:17,141 --> 00:20:19,074
You said that doctor stitched
me up and then I can go!

541
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:20,341
We just want you
to be safe, Bo.

542
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:21,641
Yeah, well,
save it, lady.

543
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:23,341
Look, ma'am, thanks
for fixing me.

544
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:24,641
‐ I'm going.
‐ Hey, wait, wait, wait!

545
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,174
If you want me to sign
something, I'll sign it!

546
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:27,941
Don't do that!
You'll rip your vein open.

547
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,274
I don't want to have you
bleeding all over the place.

548
00:20:29,307 --> 00:20:30,641
You know what?
Then take it out.

549
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,974
Okay. You wanna leave that bad?
That's fine.

550
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,874
Let me get the right instrument,
I'll take it out.

551
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:36,341
You can go about
your business.

552
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:40,374
Please just wait here.
Just wait one minute.

553
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,841
I'll be right back.

554
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,241
‐ What's going on?
‐ 'We can't let him leave.'

555
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:48,341
Well, when's the
mother getting here?

556
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:49,374
Haven't reached her yet.

557
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:50,574
I'm calling down psych.

558
00:20:50,607 --> 00:20:52,207
He'll be gone by then.

559
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,007
‐ What was that?
‐ Versed.

560
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,141
I'm going
to have to sedate him

561
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,874
till the mother
gets here.

562
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:02,374
That might be an option
if it wasn't totally unethical.

563
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:04,441
Oh, not with someone's
life at stake.

564
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:07,207
You can't restrain
someone with drugs.

565
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:08,607
He was agitated.

566
00:21:08,641 --> 00:21:11,241
To finish the treatment,
we had to sedate him.

567
00:21:11,274 --> 00:21:14,507
Security can keep him down here
until psych puts him on hold.

568
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,974
They're gonna have to prove

569
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,507
that the kid
is a danger to others.

570
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
He knows the system.
He'll just lie.

571
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:21,607
Well, maybe we'll find
his mother by then.

572
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,641
I'm gonna make sure.

573
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:25,141
Not with that.

574
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:26,341
You have a better idea?

575
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:29,107
I'll handle it.

576
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:31,107
You know what
he'll do if you don't.

577
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,641
I understand
your motive

578
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,407
and I know I asked
for your help.

579
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:38,107
Why don't you stick
with the clinic patients.

580
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:40,241
Leave the ER ones
to me, alright?

581
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,141
Good luck.

582
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,941
Look, it don't matter what I'm
gonna go do. That's my business.

583
00:21:50,974 --> 00:21:52,907
Well, I don't want you ending
up here again, maybe dead.

584
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,907
If it goes down like that,
it goes down like that.

585
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:56,607
It wouldn't be
the first time.

586
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:59,607
You don't mean that.

587
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,241
Yo! What's
the rent‐a‐cop doing here?

588
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:04,241
I want you to be able
to talk to somebody.

589
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,307
Damn! I trusted you.

590
00:22:05,341 --> 00:22:06,641
Hey, I'm just trying
to help you.

591
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:08,874
Save it, lady.
Look, I ain't talking to nobody.

592
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:11,074
Okay. We'll just wait
until your mom gets here.

593
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,274
My mom? What,
you called my mom?

594
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,641
I'll be right back.

595
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,074
Don't let him leave.

596
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:20,374
'Pay attention, Dale.'

597
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,407
Peter is one of the fastest

598
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,141
colon dissectors around.

599
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:25,074
Now that Lizzie's gun's
in the holster for a while.

600
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,141
Alright. We've got
an open abdomen, people.

601
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:29,207
Let's turn up
the heat, please.

602
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:31,074
Elizabeth, would you retract
the descending colon

603
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:33,041
while I free up
the peritoneal reflection?

604
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,607
My pleasure.

605
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:37,374
Uh, actually, Dale, why
don't you retract the Bovie

606
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:39,107
and give Lizzie
the sucker.

607
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:42,341
Right. Lizzie, suck out
this oozing area, would you?

608
00:22:42,374 --> 00:22:45,374
If you don't mind, I've never
cared for being called Lizzie.

609
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:47,207
'Really? Dr. Romano calls
you that all the time.'

610
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,041
'Dale, what structure
am I dissecting?'

611
00:22:50,074 --> 00:22:52,407
Uh, ilioinguinal nerve.

612
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:53,974
Oh, boy.

613
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,574
Elizabeth, would you
help him out, please?

614
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:59,241
Owing to the slight peristalsis,
it's obviously the left ureter.

615
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,541
Better get a little faster
with that suction, Lizzie.

616
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,207
'Okay. I've freed the sigmoid.'

617
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,074
Elizabeth, would you come
over here and ligate

618
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:07,441
the proximal side while I clamp
the vessels from below, please?

619
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:08,941
Certainly.

620
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,974
Dale, move over
and start irrigating.

621
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,907
'I'd prefer Dale
do any ligating.'

622
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,907
Just as soon as we finish
the mesenteric vessels.

623
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,407
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Romano,
but Dr. Greene is calling again.

624
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,007
Oops. Lizzie, I think you
just contaminated yourself.

625
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,441
‐ I did not.
‐ Better be safe, change gowns.

626
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:25,641
I didn't contaminate myself.

627
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,174
I saw it.
She's clean.

628
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:30,507
‐ Thank you.
‐ So don't pick on her.

629
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,907
Lizzie, scrub out and
go pacify Greene, would you?

630
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:44,307
‐ Hey. You're still here.
‐ Yeah.

631
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,941
You're certainly putting
a lot of effort

632
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,541
into this pedes ER,
I'll give you that.

633
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:48,574
Well, I'll take it.

634
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,974
‐ Hey, guys.
‐ Hey.

635
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:51,441
This is our new
pedes ER attending

636
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:53,474
and full‐time
delivery boy, Doug Ross.

637
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:54,907
What have you got for us, Doug?

638
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:56,541
You're cut off.
He's a bad tipper.

639
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,041
'This is Claudia Olsen.'

640
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,274
She's one of the candidates
for the new chief

641
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,541
of emergency medicine.

642
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:01,941
‐ 'Oh, a masochist, huh?'
‐ 'Yeah.'

643
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,241
‐ 'Good luck.'
‐ 'Thanks.'

644
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:05,207
‐ Kerry Weaver.
‐ The interim chief.

645
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:07,407
Yeah. It's nice
to meet you.

646
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:09,474
I take it you're
interviewing today as well.

647
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,041
How did you guess?

648
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,574
Well, at least
I got to go first.

649
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:14,907
It was nice
to meet you.

650
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:17,174
You, too.

651
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,007
'It could be hepatitis.'

652
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,074
But our major concern is that
you're rejecting the liver.

653
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,407
Well, I feel fine,
a little tired.

654
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:26,907
Do you ever forget
to take your meds?

655
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,474
No. I set my watch daily.

656
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,974
My cyclosporine level's
therapeutic, isn't it?

657
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:35,241
Mm‐hmm. I think we should
arrange for a liver biopsy.

658
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,574
If it's all the same to you

659
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:39,307
I would really rather
see my own doctor.

660
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:41,274
I‐I understand, but he
hasn't said anything to you

661
00:24:41,307 --> 00:24:43,907
about your
abnormal LFTs?

662
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,641
No. I got busy,
missed a couple of check‐ups.

663
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,641
Well, I'm sure you know
how important follow‐ups are

664
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:50,574
after organ
transplantation.

665
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,207
I think part of me
always suspected

666
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:58,141
but didn't want
to know for sure.

667
00:25:00,341 --> 00:25:02,174
Now I do.

668
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,374
You can always put yourself
on the UNOS list again.

669
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,941
I don't think so.
Second time around?

670
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,574
You qualified the first time.
You never know.

671
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,241
You could get lucky again.

672
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:12,874
‐ Hi.
‐ You have the Munoz kid?

673
00:25:12,907 --> 00:25:16,074
I do. Yes. Excuse me
one more time. Excuse me.

674
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:18,407
Is it cardiomyopathy?

675
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,941
The boy's going to need
a full‐EP workup.

676
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:21,274
Did he have an ectopy?

677
00:25:21,307 --> 00:25:23,941
No, and the echo ruled out
an outlet obstruction.

678
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:25,307
So the cause
of his fainting..

679
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:27,107
It's probably arrhythmia.

680
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,441
I'm going to try to induce it
in the cath lab

681
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:31,007
and if so,
he's going to need

682
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,941
an internal cardioverter
defibrillator right away.

683
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:34,407
Okay. I'm glad
we caught it.

684
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,341
Yeah. I'll call a cardiac
surgeon. Can you get consent?

685
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:37,507
Sure. Thank you.

686
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,174
Oh, don't thank me.
The kid needs it.

687
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,341
Yeah.

688
00:25:50,474 --> 00:25:52,341
It's about time.
Where's Romano?

689
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:53,374
Just me, I'm afraid.

690
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:55,041
So, can you admit him?

691
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,107
Based on my other
responsibilities, I'd say no.

692
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:58,441
So you're here
to stall me?

693
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,007
Something like that.

694
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,874
That's alright.
I'll pass him through radiology.

695
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,307
He needs
an angiogram anyway

696
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:05,441
but tell Romano
you only bought him 20 minutes.

697
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:07,174
Yeah, just don't leave
the patient there too long.

698
00:26:07,207 --> 00:26:09,174
Radiologists have a way of
snatching the procedures

699
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,241
for themselves if the surgeons
are slow on the uptake.

700
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:13,174
Noted. Thank you.
Uh, Jeanie?

701
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,207
‐ Here's the BA on your MPA.
‐ On who?

702
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,407
‐ Lipson, trauma two.
‐ I didn't order a BA.

703
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,174
I did.
It's part of the trauma panel.

704
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:20,574
Randi put it in my box.

705
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:21,641
‐ Hey..
‐ Is something wrong?

706
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:23,407
Blood alcohol's 0.04.

707
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:24,641
That's well below
the legal limit.

708
00:26:24,674 --> 00:26:26,307
It still means
he's been drinking.

709
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:28,074
I finished my write‐up
on the vertigo.

710
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,441
I think it's just a virus
and I got you some coffee.

711
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:31,941
You don't need
to do that.

712
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:33,207
Yeah, well, I was down
in the cafeteria

713
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,407
looking for
something anyway.

714
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:35,974
Alright. Thanks.
Hey, I'll tell you what.

715
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:38,041
Why don't you start the IV
on the four‐year‐old

716
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,941
with gastroenteritis
in curtain one.

717
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,007
300cc bolus of saline.
But be careful.

718
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,274
She's dehydrated.
Could be tricky.

719
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:44,607
Right.

720
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,274
Hey, thanks a lot.

721
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:48,274
‐ I feel so much better.
‐ Glad to hear it.

722
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,241
You can call me if you'd like
some free tickets to my show.

723
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:51,541
‐ Thank you.
‐ Ooh!

724
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,607
Are you okay?

725
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,307
How'd that get there?
There you go.

726
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,274
I just didn't want things
disappearing on you. See you.

727
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,607
Hey, you haven't, by any chance,
seen a body..?

728
00:27:06,174 --> 00:27:08,274
Oh, Carol, could you
help me start an IV?

729
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,141
She's dehydrated.
I don't want to hurt the kid.

730
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:11,974
‐ Have you tried?
‐ Not yet.

731
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,907
So you haven't even
started an IV Yet?

732
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:15,274
Honestly? No.

733
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:17,507
This is ridiculous, Lucy.
Everyone thinks you can.

734
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,141
I know. I'm gonna
talk to Dr. Carter today.

735
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:21,207
Well, if you don't, I will.

736
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,607
Hey! Hey!

737
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,341
‐ What happened?
‐ He took off.

738
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:27,274
Yeah, I can see that.
You were supposed to stop him.

739
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:28,641
There was no
talking him down.

740
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:30,241
You weren't supposed
to negotiate with him.

741
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:32,207
You were supposed to
stop him from leaving.

742
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:34,307
I can't keep him here
until you get the hold.

743
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:37,307
He didn't know that.

744
00:27:37,341 --> 00:27:38,341
‐ Sorry.
‐ Oh, God.

745
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:43,541
'Hold still.
I want to secure this catheter.'

746
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:46,941
Hang on. Doing great.

747
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:48,174
How much longer?

748
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:51,507
A little bit.
Just a second here.

749
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:54,974
Okay. Now, you're going to roll
back over on your back, okay?

750
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,407
Nice and easy.

751
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,074
How long does
it take to work?

752
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:02,907
About 20 minutes
for the full effect.

753
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,974
You're going to start feeling
things pretty soon, though.

754
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:07,441
I'm gonna put you
on a six‐day cycle.

755
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:11,174
Three days before the surgery,
three days after, for the drip.

756
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:13,441
‐ Dr. Romano.
‐ Dr. Ross.

757
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:14,641
Hi, Dana.

758
00:28:14,674 --> 00:28:17,474
I decided I wanted the epidural.

759
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:18,541
You did?

760
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:19,641
You were in surgery

761
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:22,074
so I explained the protocol.

762
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,241
And the parents?

763
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:24,474
They're on board.

764
00:28:26,074 --> 00:28:28,074
Terrific.
You got a second?

765
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:30,107
Sure.

766
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,307
Alright. I'll be right back.
You did great.

767
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,007
Congratulations. You just
postponed the surgery.

768
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,041
You didn't leave me
lot of options.

769
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:40,507
Let me clear you on something.

770
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,307
That pedes attending thing
just barely happened.

771
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:44,041
I voted for it because
I thought, the guy's a maverick

772
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:45,507
good to shake things up
every once in a while.

773
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,341
But if you want to play John
Wayne, do it down in the ER

774
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:49,341
and not up here
with my patients, capiche?

775
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,341
This girl is in
a very vulnerable place.

776
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:52,974
‐ Three days is not a lot to‐‐
‐ You're not hearing me, Ross.

777
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,141
This is not about being right.

778
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:55,641
Hell, we all think
we're right.

779
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:57,274
It doesn't make
you special.

780
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,941
Fine.

781
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:03,974
So, did you give the
kid a cheeseburger

782
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:05,107
before or after the parents

783
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,141
agreed to the protocol?

784
00:29:06,174 --> 00:29:07,174
I thought I might need

785
00:29:07,207 --> 00:29:10,141
24 hours to talk
them into it.

786
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:12,341
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

787
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:14,841
Hold on. Let me get
a smaller gauge.

788
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,441
‐ Oh, hey, you.
‐ Hi.

789
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:23,241
I have been looking
for you all over.

790
00:29:23,274 --> 00:29:24,607
What happened?
You forgot about me?

791
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:26,141
Well, I, uh..

792
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,574
No, I didn't, I didn't
forget about you.

793
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:29,441
I have been waiting
for three hours.

794
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:31,474
Um...okay, I went
to the morgue.

795
00:29:31,507 --> 00:29:32,507
Me, too. He's not
there anymore.

796
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:33,974
No, he is not there.

797
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:35,874
So where'd you put him?

798
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,174
Uh, I don't know how to..

799
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:39,607
'How to what?'

800
00:29:41,674 --> 00:29:46,641
How to tell you how sorry
I am about your loss.

801
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:49,241
Thank you.
But where did you put him?

802
00:29:49,274 --> 00:29:51,207
‐ Where did I put him?
‐ You don't remember.

803
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:52,274
Of course I remember.

804
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:54,274
Um, I couldn't find you.

805
00:29:54,307 --> 00:29:55,474
I got very busy here

806
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,974
so I put your brother..

807
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:02,241
Where did I put him?

808
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:03,341
Radiology.

809
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,174
I put him in radiology

810
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:08,374
but he was kind of
in the way there, so..

811
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,607
...I left him...here..

812
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:12,907
...in the hall.

813
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,574
I'm sorry.

814
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:19,541
No problem. I can't believe
I didn't see him there. Hmm.

815
00:30:19,574 --> 00:30:20,841
He's easy to miss.

816
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:24,341
‐ What's wrong?
‐ Nothing.

817
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:25,874
There aren't
any pregnancy tests.

818
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,341
How could we be
out of pregnancy tests?

819
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:28,507
I don't do inventory.

820
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,174
It wasn't
an accusation.

821
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:33,007
‐ Ooh! What is that all about?
‐ What?

822
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,907
The scarf.
Where'd you get it?

823
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:37,007
Got it at the gift shop.
You don't think it works?

824
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,274
What was wrong
with your jacket?

825
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,641
I wanted to try
something different.

826
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,074
Okay, lose the earrings.

827
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:42,107
It's throwing the whole
thing off‐balance.

828
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,574
Carol, Carol.

829
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:45,474
Oh, no, it's only my second
stick. I think I can get it.

830
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,541
I can't have students
starting IVs

831
00:30:46,574 --> 00:30:47,874
on kids under ten years old.

832
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:50,141
‐ Can you do it for me?
‐ Sure.

833
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:51,941
‐ Is there a problem?
‐ 'No, it's not a problem.'

834
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:55,374
I just want experienced
staff starting IVs on kids.

835
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,641
This is still a teaching
hospital, isn't it?

836
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:58,174
Until they inflict
pain on children.

837
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,874
Lucy's great at IVs.
Show him.

838
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:02,607
This is not about Lucy.
It's a policy I'm setting.

839
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,374
Oh, you're
setting a policy.

840
00:31:04,407 --> 00:31:07,307
Well...first time
for everything.

841
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:16,941
I'd be in a hurry
to get out of here too.

842
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:18,174
What?

843
00:31:18,207 --> 00:31:19,474
We found out why
your transplanted

844
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:22,841
liver's failing,
you've been drinking.

845
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,241
You're not going
to believe me.

846
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:28,941
One time.

847
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:29,974
You're right.
I don't believe you.

848
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:31,274
I checked with UNOS

849
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,574
and you've been on the list

850
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,574
for another transplant
for two months.

851
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:39,307
Did you tell them?

852
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:41,007
Did I tell them what?

853
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:42,441
That you drank through
the first one that they gave you

854
00:31:42,474 --> 00:31:43,974
and now you
want another one?

855
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,274
Come on. It wasn't like that.
It was just a day.

856
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,941
My son passed
his bar examination.

857
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,970
I knew I was rejecting,
so I figured what could it hurt?

858
00:31:54,003 --> 00:31:56,670
We had champagne at brunch.
That's it. I swear.

859
00:31:56,703 --> 00:31:59,837
Well, you've been lying ever
since you came in here.

860
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,770
Please...you
can't tell UNOS.

861
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:05,903
I really don't
have a choice.

862
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:07,470
Wait, wait, wait, please,
you're doing this to me

863
00:32:07,503 --> 00:32:08,870
over one glass
of champagne?

864
00:32:08,903 --> 00:32:10,737
Look, there are plenty
of people on that list

865
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,437
who haven't had
any champagne.

866
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,503
If I lose my place,
I won't last six months.

867
00:32:17,537 --> 00:32:18,937
You report me..

868
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,603
...I'm dead.

869
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:24,570
I'm begging you.

870
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,103
Sorry I'm late.
There was traffic.

871
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:33,703
You take the El.

872
00:32:33,737 --> 00:32:35,570
‐ Who's on?
‐ Weaver.

873
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,970
She's upstairs interviewing
for chief of emergency medicine.

874
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:39,070
I thought she was chief.

875
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:40,770
Where have you been?

876
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:41,970
Dr. Greene?

877
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,003
He's upstairs
interviewing her.

878
00:32:44,037 --> 00:32:45,437
So we have no attendings.

879
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,603
Hey, watch it, Jerry.

880
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:48,103
Sorry, Dr. Ross.

881
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:50,837
Is he an attending?

882
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,403
Hey, listen, uh, normally
I wouldn't say anything

883
00:32:53,437 --> 00:32:56,737
but don't you think that attire
is a little inappropriate?

884
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:57,903
It's business.

885
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:00,403
I was helping out
Dr. Weaver.

886
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:02,570
‐ Thank you.
‐ It was a great job, Kerry.

887
00:33:02,603 --> 00:33:03,970
‐ We'd be lucky to have you.
‐ Thank you.

888
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:06,070
I know it was a formality,
but thanks for coming in.

889
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,437
Well, I appreciate
the opportunity.

890
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,637
Your presentation was
everything we expected.

891
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:14,837
‐ Thank you.
‐ Hey, I'll walk you down.

892
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,570
Went great, Kerry.

893
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,603
You don't think the pie
charts were too much?

894
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:20,703
‐ No, charts are good.
‐ Did anybody else use them?

895
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:22,070
You're the first.

896
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,770
You know, if I came
across as too eager‐‐

897
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:25,537
No, it went terrific, Kerry.

898
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,070
Thank you, Mark.

899
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:28,937
I never know how to
answer that question

900
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,803
about my
weaknesses and‐‐

901
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:33,837
Yeah, well, I could have
helped you out there.

902
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,703
That's a nice
leather jacket.

903
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,703
No, I said I wanted
to run some tests

904
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:40,503
but I can't
without Medicaid.

905
00:33:40,537 --> 00:33:41,537
What's wrong?

906
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,970
Ah.

907
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,537
Didn't you know this
patient was illegal?

908
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,803
Yes, I did,
but it doesn't matter.

909
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,603
Oh, yes, it matters.

910
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:49,737
We're talking about thousands
of dollars worth of tests.

911
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,570
‐ The state's not gonna pay.
‐ So you won't treat him?

912
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:52,737
I'll give him
some beta blockers.

913
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,103
He could have
a sudden cardiac arrest.

914
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:55,137
We've been monitoring
him for three hours.

915
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,437
He's had no arrhythmias.

916
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,903
That's why we need
the EP studies.

917
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:59,703
His father and brother
have already died from this.

918
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,903
Did you document
an arrhythmia?

919
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:03,537
‐ No, but his mother said‐‐
‐ Alright.

920
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,403
Then there is nothing
else that I can do.

921
00:34:05,437 --> 00:34:09,003
Dr. Kayson, this boy could
drop dead and you know it.

922
00:34:09,037 --> 00:34:11,437
Well, so could
a lot of people.

923
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,137
He's not emergent.

924
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,970
I'm sorry.

925
00:34:28,537 --> 00:34:29,603
You said he was stable.

926
00:34:29,637 --> 00:34:31,770
‐ Single GSW to the arm.
‐ He was.

927
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,570
He's intubated
and hypotensive.

928
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:35,603
‐ Things change en route, okay?
‐ What's the problem?

929
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:37,470
Botched gang shooting.
They were ready for him.

930
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:38,670
Is this the guy
from this morning?

931
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,403
Yeah, his name's Bo.

932
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:41,937
Uh, look, we really thought
it was just his arm.

933
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,703
‐ He crashed in the rig.
‐ Carter, we need your help.

934
00:34:43,737 --> 00:34:45,070
Come on.

935
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,437
Alright,
welcome back, Bo.

936
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,137
Okay, everybody,
on my count.

937
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,670
One, two, three.

938
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:53,070
Why didn't you recontact?

939
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:54,603
Things got
pretty crazy.

940
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:55,703
Alright, Carol,
put him on the monitor.

941
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:56,970
'What do we got?'

942
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:59,437
Through‐and‐through GSW,
mid‐tricep area.

943
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,470
‐ Where's the probe?
‐ Run it, Carter.

944
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:03,137
Decreased breath sounds
on the right.

945
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,370
Tracheal shift to the left.

946
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,403
Tension pneumo.

947
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,670
BP's down to 70.

948
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:08,403
‐ Pulse ox 89.
‐ Damn it!

949
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:09,803
20cc syringe.

950
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:11,837
And then I'm gonna
need a 36 French.

951
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,437
Alright, you want
to decompress

952
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,103
in the second intercostal space,
midclavicular line.

953
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,470
Okay, pulse is
getting stronger.

954
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:21,770
Alright, Lucy, get a blood gas.

955
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,103
‐ I'll do it.
‐ No, that's okay.

956
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:24,437
I showed her how to
do it this morning.

957
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,870
Ten blade.

958
00:35:25,903 --> 00:35:27,570
'Alright, get the
pressure bag on the line.'

959
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:28,670
'Entrance wound'

960
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:31,470
'right mid‐axillary line.'

961
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:33,603
Bullet went through
the arm into the chest.

962
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:36,003
‐ Why couldn't you undress him?
‐ 'We had to scoop and run.'

963
00:35:36,037 --> 00:35:37,903
'Alright, where's
that chest tube?'

964
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,870
I can't believe you didn't
see this chest wound.

965
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:41,803
‐ Not now, Carol.
‐ I can't get the blood gas.

966
00:35:41,837 --> 00:35:43,903
Move over, I'll do it.

967
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:45,770
Alright,
chest tube is in.

968
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:47,437
That's okay, Lucy.
Those can be tough.

969
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,937
Come around here, help me
with the second line.

970
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,503
Okay, 50cc's out.

971
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:54,137
I need four by fours.
I need Elastoplast.

972
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,470
'Let's call x‐ray and get
a portable chest down here.'

973
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:57,503
I got the blood gas.

974
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:59,670
BP's up to 100/70.

975
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,603
‐ How's that second line coming?
‐ I can't.

976
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:02,870
Hey, move the drape.
You got more room.

977
00:36:02,903 --> 00:36:05,070
‐ No, I can't do it.
‐ Come on, Lucy, focus.

978
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,645
‐ I really can't.
‐ It's just like any other IV.

979
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,678
I haven't started an IV,
I don't know how.

980
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:12,245
I never have.
I'm sorry.

981
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,445
Whoa! He's bradying down.

982
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:20,312
Chest tube is
pouring out blood! Let's go.

983
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,145
Get two units of O‐neg
in and call the OR.

984
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:26,145
You cost me a procedure.

985
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:27,645
Am I supposed
to ask how?

986
00:36:27,678 --> 00:36:29,612
You were supposed to baby‐sit
that pulseless foot for me.

987
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,378
Greene let
the radiologists at him.

988
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:34,178
I didn't realize that was
part of my job description.

989
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:36,512
Hmm. Well,
you're still learning.

990
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:37,678
Mm‐hmm.

991
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,545
How was your first day?

992
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,145
As expected.

993
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,545
You are either a masochist

994
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,478
or the stubbornest woman
I've ever met.

995
00:36:46,512 --> 00:36:48,778
But I have to say,
I admire your fortitude.

996
00:36:48,812 --> 00:36:52,578
I couldn't handle taking orders
from a weasel like Dale.

997
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:54,645
Is that supposed
to be a compliment?

998
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,612
Sounded like one to me.

999
00:36:57,645 --> 00:36:59,712
Oh, and you can wear
the long coat.

1000
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:01,012
It looks better on you.

1001
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:06,145
‐ '700cc's out the chest tube.'
‐ Take him up, Carter.

1002
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:07,278
They know he needs
a thoracotomy?

1003
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,045
Yeah. OR three.

1004
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,278
Have the blood bank send up
four units type specific.

1005
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,245
Yup. Hey, we were not
prepared for a major trauma.

1006
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:15,745
You should have called
when he crumped.

1007
00:37:15,778 --> 00:37:17,778
Sorry. We were a little busy
protecting his airway.

1008
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,212
Time out.

1009
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:20,245
You guys should
have called ahead.

1010
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:21,445
There was no way‐‐

1011
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:23,045
Ah...you guys
should have called ahead.

1012
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,645
And Carol, we have to be
prepared for anything.

1013
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:26,478
‐ I would have been prepared‐‐
‐ Nobody's to blame, okay?

1014
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,645
We treated the patient.

1015
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,478
Let's move on.

1016
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:31,645
You want to stick around
and review the run tape?

1017
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:33,378
‐ No.
‐ No.

1018
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,378
Doggy. Yeah.

1019
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,278
You want to pet the doggy?

1020
00:37:38,312 --> 00:37:39,745
Mmm.

1021
00:37:39,778 --> 00:37:42,045
Oh, that is good.

1022
00:37:42,078 --> 00:37:43,778
You want him to respond
in some way, you know?

1023
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:48,078
To, uh, to point or to
make some kind of sound.

1024
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:56,712
Kitty says, "Meow. Meow."

1025
00:37:56,745 --> 00:37:59,478
Do you wanna pet the kitty?
Hmm?

1026
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,145
Oh.

1027
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,312
Don't like the kitty?

1028
00:38:03,345 --> 00:38:05,745
It's okay, man.
That's okay.

1029
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:08,112
One quick hug,
then back to work.

1030
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:09,145
What?

1031
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,678
He's got to learn to focus.

1032
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,778
Oh, come on,
give him a break.

1033
00:38:11,812 --> 00:38:13,178
He's only a year old.

1034
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,512
You can't give him a break.

1035
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,578
He's not like
other one‐year‐olds.

1036
00:38:16,612 --> 00:38:20,412
He needs constant
verbal stimuli.

1037
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:24,645
Hey, you try.

1038
00:38:27,345 --> 00:38:30,345
Alright, man.
Um...here we go.

1039
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:33,578
Doggy. Doggy.

1040
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,812
Arf!
Hey, doggy. Arf.

1041
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,645
Arf, arf, arf.

1042
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:40,145
Arf, Reese. Arf.

1043
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:47,478
I can't do this.

1044
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:50,578
You're gonna have to learn.

1045
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:54,445
Coming here twice a week
isn't gonna do it.

1046
00:38:56,612 --> 00:38:58,478
Listen, I might
have been able

1047
00:38:58,512 --> 00:39:00,578
to keep that kid here
this afternoon but

1048
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:04,045
he would've gone out and done
the same thing tomorrow.

1049
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:07,278
Uh, his mom's in chairs.
You want me to go talk to her?

1050
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:09,712
No, no. I'll do it.

1051
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:25,145
Forget a number?

1052
00:39:25,178 --> 00:39:26,345
Uh, no.

1053
00:39:26,378 --> 00:39:27,378
You still here?

1054
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:29,645
Yeah, I got sidetracked.

1055
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,078
Hey, you could use some help.

1056
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:32,445
Okay, take rashes.

1057
00:39:32,478 --> 00:39:35,145
I was thinking
of something more permanent.

1058
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,145
Uh, allergies?

1059
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:40,412
Actually, I meant, uh,
being your full‐time PA.

1060
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,278
Yeah. I've been
thinking about it.

1061
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:44,045
I'd love to just work
with kids for a while.

1062
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:46,778
I'm good at it and, somehow,
it seems more worthwhile.

1063
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:48,478
Well, I don't
know about that.

1064
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,412
At least you know,
whose side you're on.

1065
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,312
You know, I'd...I'd love to.

1066
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:54,412
I just think I've used up
all my chips with Anspaugh.

1067
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:57,378
I've got some pull with him.
I think I could work it out.

1068
00:39:57,412 --> 00:40:00,778
‐ Great. I'd love that.
‐ Excellent.

1069
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,178
Good.

1070
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:07,278
Yeah, hi.

1071
00:40:07,312 --> 00:40:11,778
May I have the transplant
coordinator for UNOS, please?

1072
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,112
Okay.

1073
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:26,645
‐ I paged you twice.
‐ I don't wanna talk about it.

1074
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:28,778
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I
think I deserve an explanation.

1075
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:31,745
If you want me
to feel bad, I do.

1076
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:33,278
I'm really
disappointed in myself.

1077
00:40:33,312 --> 00:40:35,745
You should be.
And that's not an explanation.

1078
00:40:35,778 --> 00:40:37,112
I don't know
how it started.

1079
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,512
I..

1080
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,412
You thought I could do it.

1081
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:43,578
I wanted to impress you and it
spun out of control. I'm sorry.

1082
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:46,778
Just, what did you think
you were going to accomplish?

1083
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,178
I don't know.

1084
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:50,512
I thought I could
learn on my own.

1085
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:52,445
Oh, great. You can
learn on your own.

1086
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:54,278
You don't need
to be here then.

1087
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:55,812
You endangered patients, Lucy.

1088
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:58,712
You don't need to make me
feel bad. I feel horrible.

1089
00:40:58,745 --> 00:41:01,212
Well, that would work
if this was about you.

1090
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:04,012
But rule number one down there
is it's never about you.

1091
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:07,245
You know what, go home.

1092
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:08,478
'Don't come back unless
you're serious'

1093
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:11,045
about learning something.

1094
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:12,478
And if you ever
lie to me again

1095
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,478
you can look
for another rotation.

1096
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:24,045
♪ Oogum oogum boogum boogum ♪

1097
00:41:24,078 --> 00:41:26,712

1100
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:37,478
What are you
doing back here?

1101
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:40,078
I'm waiting for
the grill to heat up.

1102
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:43,312
I thought this was
fend‐for‐yourself night.

1103
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:45,178
Well, I'm sick of
fend‐for‐yourself.

1104
00:41:45,212 --> 00:41:46,812
I got us some steaks.

1105
00:41:46,845 --> 00:41:48,545
Steaks sound good. You got
another one of those for me?

1106
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:49,578
Yup.

1107
00:41:52,545 --> 00:41:54,578
What's in the bag?

1108
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,512
It's a, uh...pregnancy test.

1109
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:01,745
To be sure.

1110
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:04,412
No need.
I started my period.

1111
00:42:06,678 --> 00:42:09,678
♪ Boogum now baby you're castin'
you're spell on me.. ♪

1112
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:14,545
Well, I guess
I wasted $17.50.

1113
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:19,045
Well, save it
for next time.

1114
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,578
I'm kidding.
That was a joke.

1115
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:25,445
We dodged the bullet
there, didn't we?

1116
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,212
Yup.

1117
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,045
That's good, right?

1118
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,012
Yeah, yeah.

1119
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,778
Though, all day,
I kept thinking..

1120
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:37,812
...wow, a kid.

1121
00:42:37,845 --> 00:42:39,178
You know, that would really..

1122
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:42,612
...change my life.

1123
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:45,112
Our life.
It would change ours.

1124
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,378
Okay, our lives.

1125
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:59,145
That would be bad, right?

1126
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:01,178
You know what?
I changed my mind.

1127
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:04,545
I don't want to joke about it.

1128
00:43:04,578 --> 00:43:05,778
Yeah.

1129
00:43:19,545 --> 00:43:22,212
Maybe I'm not joking.
