1
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,266
Previously on "ER."

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,533
I mean, a drink sounds great.

3
00:00:08,566 --> 00:00:09,700
Can we also
eat something?

4
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,233
What are you
talking about?

5
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:12,733
‐ You went out with her, right.
‐ We had dinner.

6
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:14,633
We should embrace
our mistakes

7
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,166
and learn from them
to improve the system.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,133
I'm going to put the microphone
holder right behind the ear.

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,500
I wanted to postpone
Reese's operation.

10
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:26,366
Are you coughing up blood?

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,266
That woman
has tuberculosis.

12
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,466
It's highly contagious.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,666
There's something
about me that

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
just brings out
the worst in people.

15
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:35,733
Merry Christmas, Amanda.

16
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,733
'Gotta beautiful
snow storm last night'

17
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:40,333
'but it's a mess
on the roads'

18
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:41,566
'and you're gonna have
to dig the car out.'

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,600
'Absolutely, I guess‐‐'

20
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,133
I should really get up.

21
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,800
Me too.

22
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,433
Have you seen
my pajama bottoms?

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,166
You really should talk to
Kerry about the heat in here.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,800
Ah, it was pretty hot
in here a minute ago.

25
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,600
Yeah, thanks.

26
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,400
So, I'll pick you up
tonight around nine?

27
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,766
Ah, I said
I'd think about it.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,100
Oh, come on, my friends
are dying to meet you.

29
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,133
Girls night out.

30
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,733
I'd feel like
I was on display.

31
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,700
Come on, it's gotta beat the
hell out of baby‐sitting

32
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,366
a med student
on a Friday night.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,766
Oh, Lucy's presenting
chief rounds tomorrow.

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,466
‐ It's a big deal.
‐ And Lucy is a big girl.

35
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,266
I'd rather spend
the night with you.

36
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,300
‐ But only with you.
‐ Mmm‐mm.

37
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,766
John, what is that?

38
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,033
Oh, that is a major drag.

39
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,433
‐ Hey.
‐ Sorry.

40
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,800
You were an easy target.

41
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,133
You've got quite an arm.

42
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,200
My grandfather
was a pitcher

43
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:44,366
for the Cincinnati Reds.

44
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,066
Must be in the genes.

45
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Someone not notice that this
is an emergency entrance.

46
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,100
The snow‐plow comes in

47
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:53,633
and just kind of pushes the snow
from one side to the other.

48
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,733
‐ I'll give maintenance a call.
‐ Yeah, don't bother.

49
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:58,266
By the time they get here,
it will be spring.

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,466
Fresh snow always
reminds me of the year

51
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,533
I spent working
in Alaska.

52
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,733
You've done it all.

53
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:05,566
I try.
Hey, oh, oh.

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,633
You got something
on your back there.

55
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,700
Ooh, that's cold.

56
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,400
Oh, oh, oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

57
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,100
Oh.

58
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,166
You okay?

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,533
‐ I'm fine.
‐ I'm sorry.

60
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,166
I'm vibrating.

61
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,266
What?

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,133
‐ It's my pager.
‐ Oh.

63
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
‐ See you inside.
‐ Yeah.

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,266
So Mark said dinner plans
are, quote, "Optional."

65
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,800
Hmm, if everything's going well
with Amanda, we should vamoose.

66
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,466
Yeah, I hope
things go well.

67
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,133
He deserves it.

68
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,366
You think they've
slept together yet?

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,666
Not if they observed
the three‐date rule.

70
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
What's the three‐date rule?

71
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,766
First date, you go out.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,366
Second date,
you get invited in.

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,533
Third date,
you close the deal.

74
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,633
Yeah, well,
if you recall

75
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,300
we closed the deal
on the first date.

76
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,233
Oh, yeah, I was never much
for rules, you know.

77
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,566
Hang on, hang on.
Call in a code white.

78
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,000
Get a gurney
and a crash cart.

79
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,700
Joi Abbott, fainted in the
cafeteria, tachycardic at 130.

80
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,166
I'm fine, really.

81
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,066
Her lips are dry,
it's probably dehydrated.

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,433
Exams two's open,
we got it from here, Doug.

83
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,533
Okay.

84
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:09,366
Ah, excuse me.

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,766
‐ Yo, can I help you?
‐ Yeah, who are you?

86
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
‐ Who are you?
‐ Who is this guy?

87
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,666
Doug Ross,
peds ER attending

88
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,066
meet Tony Fig,
transport dispatcher.

89
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,600
He's been turfed up here while
Jerry and Randi are both sick.

90
00:04:20,633 --> 00:04:22,400
Hey, some dude from NASA
called wanting to know

91
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:25,100
if you got your phase two
application packet.

92
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,733
NASA, as in
the space program?

93
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,433
Yeah, probably NASA as in
trying to sell me a time share.

94
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:31,366
‐ There's no phone number.
‐ Said they'd call back.

95
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,133
Bet it was Jerry
making a crank call.

96
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,000
He's made two
from home already.

97
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:38,333
Doug, I DC'd the otitis media.

98
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:39,800
‐ We're free and clear.
‐ Hmm.

99
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,300
'Excuse me.'

100
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,300
For a nanosecond...
yes, officer.

101
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,666
What can I do for you?

102
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,766
Scott Pew,
thought it'd be cool

103
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,433
to bumper ski
on my patrol car

104
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,333
until I made a U‐turn
and he shot into a hedge.

105
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,600
‐ Hmm‐mm.
‐ Says he broke his arm.

106
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,133
Nah, it feels more
like his elbow

107
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,600
probably a proximal
radius fracture.

108
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,100
Here, I'm gonna sit you
right down here.

109
00:04:58,133 --> 00:04:59,133
Could be a good
candidate for

110
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,166
our pain medication study.

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,466
That's a good idea, Jeanie.

112
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll get his parents' consent.

113
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:06,133
Would you mind taking
a look at my hand?

114
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,133
I got a splinter when I pulled
the kid from the bushes.

115
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:10,366
Ah, I'm working in peds today,
I'll find you someone else.

116
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,266
I'm a kid at heart.

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,566
Okay, I'll meet you in
the suture room in a minute.

118
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,666
Okay.

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
I really need to go.

120
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,166
Could you be pregnant?

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,500
No, my husband and
I are separated.

122
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,033
When was the last time
you had anything to eat?

123
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:27,166
I don't know.
Lunch yesterday..

124
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,766
Your body's malnourished.

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,466
My son's upstairs
getting an MRI.

126
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,766
And if I'm not there
when he's done‐‐

127
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,533
Oh, we can call upstairs
explain what happened

128
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,166
I'm sure they'd
keep an eye out on him.

129
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,100
He gets scared
if I'm not there.

130
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:38,533
And we have to get
to the clinic.

131
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,066
We have a clinic here.

132
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,133
Ricky goes to
the genetics clinic.

133
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,200
Will you take
this out, please?

134
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,366
Joi, what's your son's
medical condition?

135
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,233
ALD, adrenoleukodystrophy.

136
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,633
‐ Advanced?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

137
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,266
‐ Are you giving him oils?
‐ It's too late for that.

138
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,233
We'll have your lab results
back in about an hour

139
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,633
if you'd like to
come back down here

140
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,366
when you're through upstairs.

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Maybe.
Thanks.

142
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,100
Well, we tried.

143
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,466
I'm looking forward to our
double date this evening.

144
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Oh, me, too.

145
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:15,133
If you don't mind me asking..

146
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,200
...have you and Mark
ever been intimate?

147
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,633
Me and Mark?

148
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,633
No, why?

149
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,166
Well, I just wondered if he

150
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,366
makes it a habit
of seducing coworkers.

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,333
He's been
so aggressive.

152
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,533
Oh, don't get me wrong.

153
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,566
I've never been as
satisfied with anyone

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
as I am with this man.

155
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:38,066
But when someone's that
inventive, you know

156
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,466
I sort of suspect
he's a Don Juan.

157
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,766
We are talking
about Mark Greene?

158
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Last night,
on his fire escape..

159
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,166
I'll drop these at the lab.

160
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,433
Must have gotten
it from treating

161
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:52,666
that woman
in the projects.

162
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
‐ Any night sweats or fever?
‐ No.

163
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:56,666
A positive test
doesn't mean I have TB.

164
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,166
It just means
I've been exposed.

165
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,733
But you'll still
need a chest x‐ray.

166
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,500
And INH prophylaxis
for at least six months.

167
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:04,433
‐ I know the drill.
‐ Carter, I'm really sorry.

168
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,100
That's the risk
of being a doctor.

169
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,466
I'm glad you're negative.

170
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,766
Carter, Roxanne, line two.

171
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,466
Oh, thanks, Lily.

172
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,766
Ah, I have to cancel our
study plans this evening.

173
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,033
Friday night,
something's come up.

174
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,266
No problem.

175
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,166
Maybe you and Bernard
can review together.

176
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,600
Hey, what's up?

177
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,200
‐ You hated it.
‐ What? No.

178
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:23,433
I just haven't had time
to read it thoroughly, yet.

179
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,600
Do you think I have a shot
at getting it published?

180
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,100
‐ Well, it is controversial.
‐ And that's bad?

181
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,433
For you, right now,
oh, yeah.

182
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:32,300
‐ We'll see if Anspaugh agrees.
‐ Dr. Benton.

183
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,566
In there,
the patient's grandmother

184
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,333
requested you personally.

185
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,100
Yeah.

186
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:46,566
Ah, Dr. Parks,
this is a surprise.

187
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,033
Where's your interpreter?

188
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,100
I can do that.
My name is Gwen.

189
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,866
Oh, you can hear.

190
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,033
Grandma thinks
I have appendi‐‐

191
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,666
‐ Appendicitis?
‐ Yeah, that's it.

192
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,733
Okay, where does it hurt?

193
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,166
Around my bellybutton.

194
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,333
When did it start?

195
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,766
While grandma
was driving me to school

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,733
she had to pull over
so I could throw up.

197
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,366
Ah, tell your grandmother

198
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
I think you have
gastroenteritis.

199
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,433
Can you spell that?

200
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm sorry,
stomach flu.

201
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,100
You're wrong.

202
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,266
There's no
localized tenderness

203
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,033
in the right
lower quadrant.

204
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,500
Grandma wants to do
the ultrasound.

205
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,333
I'll re‐examine her
in a couple of hours.

206
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,066
See if the problem
declares itself.

207
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,733
What did she say?

208
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:41,733
Uh, she said she wants
to do the ultrasound.

209
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,166
Fine.

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,566
I don't see a splinter,
but there is something.

211
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,133
Uh, good, I'd hate for you
to think I made this up

212
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,666
just so I could
spend time with you.

213
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,766
Oh, that smile is worth
a thousand splinters.

214
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,066
‐ Ow.
‐ Oh, easy. Got it.

215
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,033
Sorry, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

216
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,266
Well, you can make it up to me
by letting me take you out.

217
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,333
I didn't hurt you that bad.

218
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,066
You will
if you say no.

219
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,366
I don't think so.

220
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
So, you've decided
not to like me.

221
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,566
‐ I don't even know you.
‐ Right, right.

222
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,533
So we go out,
you get to know me.

223
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,566
‐ Officer..
‐ Call me Reggie.

224
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,533
Reggie, I'm just not looking
to out with anyone right now.

225
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,300
You know, if it's because
you're HIV‐positive

226
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,166
I'm cool with that.

227
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,233
You're cool with that?

228
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,100
Lucky me.

229
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:40,633
Whoa, whoa.

230
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,600
I didn't...I wasn't
talking about sex.

231
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,200
I‐I like to get to
know a woman first.

232
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,666
So, how about we cross
that bridge if we come to it.

233
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,566
Oh, Dr. Weaver,
I almost forgot.

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,366
‐ Your mom called.
‐ My mom?

235
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,566
Yep, this morning,
right before I left the house.

236
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,300
What did she say exactly?

237
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,166
Just that, uh,
she'd try again later.

238
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,633
‐ Am I supposed to get that?
‐ No, I got it.

239
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,500
‐ Did she ask for me by name?
‐ Your mom?

240
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,033
'County General, go ahead.'

241
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,266
'County, be advised of'

242
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
'a commuter plane crash
at Meig's Field.'

243
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:16,266
'Anticipating up to
14 trauma patients.'

244
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,100
'How many can you handle?
Over.'

245
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,066
We can take
three major, seven minor.

246
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,433
Do you have an ETA? Over.

247
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:22,633
'Negative, we're
waiting reports'

248
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,533
'from the scene, over.'

249
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,233
Alright, this is County General.
Clear on med nine.

250
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,400
Okay, everyone, we have
a mass casualty incident.

251
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,633
Implement disaster protocol.

252
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,200
Carol, set up
the curtains one and two

253
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,233
trauma two and three
for critical patients.

254
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:38,100
John, will you put IV stands
and gurneys in the hallway?

255
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,766
I need warm saline,
rapid infusers

256
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,633
and two units of O‐negative
available at every bedside.

257
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,466
I appreciate your
hard work but I..

258
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,700
...don't think it's
appropriate for publication.

259
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,466
How can we effect change
unless we create an open forum?

260
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,633
I support change, Elizabeth

261
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:55,033
but I don't believe your
paper is the proper tool.

262
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:56,700
You object to me
referencing my own mistake

263
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,766
because it paints
County General in a poor light.

264
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,633
No, it paints you
in a poor light.

265
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,800
It has a confessional
quality that concerns me.

266
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,666
I suggest you find
out the true motives

267
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,433
for writing this paper

268
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,033
before you become hell‐bent

269
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,700
on sharing it
with the world.

270
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,800
Nothing like
a multi‐victim trauma

271
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,366
to get the blood pumping.

272
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,700
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Dale Edson.

273
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,233
Third‐year surgical resident.

274
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,100
Lucy Knight, third‐year
medical student.

275
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,633
Working with
the esteemed John Carter

276
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,700
former surgical intern.

277
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:26,033
I didn't know that.

278
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:27,433
Wait until you do
surgical rotation.

279
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,466
You'll find that he makes
emergency medicine

280
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,400
look like child's play.

281
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,433
Here, let me help
you with that.

282
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,700
Thanks.

283
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,033
You ever been on
a riverboat casino?

284
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,400
Like in New Orleans?

285
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,666
Like in Elgin.

286
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,366
It's a stellar boat,
the Grand Victoria.

287
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm heading up there this
evening to try my hand

288
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,300
at lady luck.
Would you like to join me?

289
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,800
I've never been
gambling before.

290
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,566
Lucy, don't you need to prepare
for chief rounds tomorrow?

291
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,333
Oh, right.
I probably shouldn't.

292
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,633
When you're through here,
check the O‐neg supply.

293
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,633
I can help you on it
during the drive up.

294
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,600
‐ I mean, if you want me to.
‐ That would actually be great.

295
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:55,700
Come on,
we got work to do.

296
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,166
This place won't
be the same without you.

297
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
Am I going someplace?

298
00:12:01,433 --> 00:12:03,600
You don't have
to play dumb, Doug.

299
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,400
Matt Richmond phoned.

300
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,700
I downplayed you,
of course, I'm not an idiot.

301
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,200
Well, I am, because
I have no idea

302
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,766
what you're talking about.

303
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,066
Who's this, uh, Richmond guy?

304
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,433
He runs an HMO,
headquartered in Portland.

305
00:12:17,466 --> 00:12:19,466
They're looking for someone
to set up pediatric ER's

306
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,066
in their facilities
around the country.

307
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,533
Dr. Lee, blood bank's
on the phone for you.

308
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,200
‐ Oh, thanks.
‐ Don't worry, Amanda.

309
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,300
‐ I'm not going anywhere.
‐ Glad to hear it.

310
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,200
So you actually applied
to the space program?

311
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,533
My second year of residency.

312
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,800
‐ I made the first cut.
‐ What happened?

313
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,433
Uh, Rachel was just
barely out of diapers

314
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,666
and Jen was
starting law school.

315
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,333
I tried to defer,
but they wouldn't let me.

316
00:12:39,366 --> 00:12:41,266
So that call from NASA
could have been for real.

317
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,400
Uh, I doubt it.

318
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:44,433
Trauma room's ready.

319
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:46,800
Great.
Thanks, you guys.

320
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,700
You two seem to be
moving right along.

321
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,000
She's kind of
playing hard to get.

322
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,566
Carter, Lucy and Lily will
handle minors in the main hall.

323
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
‐ Got it.
‐ Mark.

324
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,633
I've assigned you
and Carol to trauma one.

325
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,633
Kerry, you and Chuny
in trauma two.

326
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,200
Lydia and I will float.

327
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:03,366
'Come in, County General.'

328
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,700
Any critical peds,
Jeanie and I

329
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,166
will take them
in curtain three.

330
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,666
This is County.
Over.

331
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,366
Everybody hear that?
Critical peds, curtain three.

332
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,066
'Be advised, your facility'

333
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,300
'has been instructed
to stand down. Over.'

334
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,666
Command center,
we're prepared.

335
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,333
We're ready to
handle patients. Over.

336
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,766
‐ Stand down?
‐ Stop prepping.

337
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,566
'There were
no survivors on scene.'

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,700
'Repeat, no survivors.
Over.'

339
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,300
Copy that, dispatch.

340
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:43,727
Any messages for me?

341
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,960
And you are?

342
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,060
Dr. Weaver. "Weaver."

343
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,060
Yeah. One, sounded
kind of important.

344
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:50,927
‐ From my mother?
‐ Your dentist.

345
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,893
Okay, any calls for me,
business or otherwise, page me.

346
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,793
I got you covered.
Dr. Greene.

347
00:13:55,827 --> 00:14:00,327
Overnight delivery.
Check out the return address.

348
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,093
NASA.
You deserting me?

349
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:03,293
No, of course not.

350
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,793
Got another, behind us.

351
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:06,827
Okay, I'll take this one.

352
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,727
‐ Amanda.
‐ Yeah?

353
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,993
42 year old female.

354
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:11,827
Blunt head trauma
from a collapsed chimney.

355
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,160
‐ Chimney?
‐ Possible LOC.

356
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:14,227
Complains of headache
shortness of breath.

357
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,860
Help me! Help...me!

358
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,660
‐ What's her name?
‐ Edie Harvell.

359
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:19,293
Don't worry, Edie.
You're in good hands.

360
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,060
Blunt trauma to the chest and
abdomen from falling bricks.

361
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,193
‐ 'Complains of abdominal pain.'
‐ 'Vitals?'

362
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,827
BP a 100 palp,
pulse 110.

363
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,860
'On my count.
One, two, three.'

364
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:29,993
Help...me.

365
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:33,093
Pupils equal.
React to light.

366
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:35,127
'Go...home.'

367
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,627
Tachypneic and tachycardic.

368
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,160
Edie, do you have
any chest pain?

369
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,093
Pain...every...where.

370
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,927
‐ BP's 130 over 82.
‐ Possible pneumothorax.

371
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,160
I want a CBC, a chem panel,
and send off cardiac enzymes.

372
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:49,293
'We've got to
rule out an MI.'

373
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,827
She's young for an MI.

374
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,627
Yeah, but I don't
wanna take any chances.

375
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,527
Do you mind checking on Kerry?

376
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,727
'Pressure's holding at 100.'

377
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,227
He's a psychologist,
said he was

378
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
treating your patient
when the accident occurred.

379
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:02,327
What were you
treating her for?

380
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,760
Agoraphobia.

381
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,293
Edie's terrified
of public places.

382
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,193
‐ Lungs are clear.
‐ Including hospitals?

383
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:08,727
Pulse ox looks good, 98.

384
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,927
I was using
a desensitization approach.

385
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,760
I got her to step outside
her house for the first time

386
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,827
in five years when
a chimney fell on top of us.

387
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,093
‐ It was freakish.
‐ Call CT.

388
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,660
Right upper‐quadrant tenderness.

389
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:18,893
Does she have panic attacks?

390
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:20,627
‐ Up to 30 a day.
‐ Great.

391
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
CT can take him now.

392
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:22,893
Okay, let's get him upstairs.

393
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:24,693
She has relaxation
music with her.

394
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:25,827
That may help.

395
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,327
EKG. Normal.

396
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,760
‐ Lips...numb.
‐ Edie, my name is Dr. Greene.

397
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:37,027
You're in a hospital.

398
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,627
Nothing bad can
happen to you here.

399
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,593
Hospitals...bad.

400
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:43,760
Let go of the Walkman.

401
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,793
Haleh, I want you to try
and find a Yanni tape.

402
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:50,927
Keep breathing.

403
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,760
Alright, yeah,
there's some fluid

404
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,893
around the edematous appendix.

405
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,860
E‐d‐e..

406
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,260
Mom.

407
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:06,927
'That's my mom.'

408
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,793
She was on a
field trip with her students

409
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,260
while grandma called her.

410
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:13,793
‐ Hey, what does this mean?
‐ "Father."

411
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:15,860
She says you're
the father of the deaf boy.

412
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,327
Oh, do me a favor.

413
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,560
Tell your mother and your
grandma...never mind.

414
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:23,793
Um, hey, hey,
excuse me.

415
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,993
Uh, listen,
she, um..

416
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,193
...uh, sheesh.

417
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,127
Ah, appendix.

418
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,227
Appendix, yeah, yeah.
Right.

419
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:39,593
I'm gonna have an operation?

420
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:41,293
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But it‐it‐it's fine.

421
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:43,093
Wait!

422
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,327
Mom needs a signer.

423
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,127
Grandma's not a surgeon.

424
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,660
'I need to ask questions.'

425
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,060
The hospital needs
to provide one.

426
00:16:53,093 --> 00:16:54,793
Yeah, yeah. That's...look,
I'll take care of it.

427
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,927
It's‐it's no problem.

428
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Am I gonna be okay?

429
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,260
You're gonna be fine.

430
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:02,860
‐ Edie.
‐ What?

431
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,927
This mask will
help you breathe.

432
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,560
Okay, now just
inhale like this.

433
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,160
‐ No, no.
‐ Nice and easy.

434
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,727
‐ Mask off.
‐ No, no, no. Mask on.

435
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,193
Mask off.

436
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:14,627
Mark.

437
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,260
Bad news.
CT's down.

438
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,827
Oh, I'm not getting
through to her.

439
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,693
I don't wanna put her on
sedation until we rule out

440
00:17:26,727 --> 00:17:28,060
an intracranial bleed

441
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,593
but we may have no choice.

442
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,160
Let me try something.

443
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,893
Okay, Edie.

444
00:17:34,927 --> 00:17:36,127
'I want you to
close your eyes.'

445
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,660
No, I...can't.

446
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,793
Sure, you can.

447
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:41,793
Close your eyes.

448
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,860
And I want you to imagine
yourself as a little girl

449
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:47,560
'Someplace warm and safe.'

450
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:49,860
‐ It's...dark.
‐ No, it's not.

451
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,027
Close your eyes.

452
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,193
It's light
and it's airy.

453
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:56,160
And it's warm
and it's safe.

454
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:57,227
Can you tell me
where you are?

455
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,793
I...kitchen.

456
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,060
Uh‐huh.
Good.

457
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,960
And who's
with you there?

458
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:07,227
‐ Mom.
‐ Your mom?

459
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
She's baking something.

460
00:18:09,293 --> 00:18:11,593
It smells really yummy.

461
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:14,693
Can you tell me
what she's baking?

462
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:19,727
‐ Cookies.
‐ "Cookies." Very good.

463
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,160
That's good.

464
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,027
'Sshh.'

465
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,627
'That's good.'

466
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,793
I'm sorry if I
offended you earlier.

467
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,693
‐ It's not what I meant to do.
‐ Don't worry about it.

468
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,060
I'm trying to think
of something to tell you

469
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,127
about myself to even
the playing field.

470
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,627
Reggie, that's not necessary.

471
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,127
How I'm broke,
or got suspended once?

472
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,927
‐ It's not that simple.
‐ Yeah, I know.

473
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,093
The truth is, there's nothing
in my life that compares to‐‐

474
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,293
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

475
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,560
Don't feel
sorry for me, okay.

476
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:45,893
I'm doing great.

477
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,060
Where did you learn that?

478
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,127
I did research on
phobias in med school.

479
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,227
Actually got published in
the Cornell medical journal

480
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,060
which is a pretty big
deal for a third‐year.

481
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,860
I'd love to read the article.
Do you still have a copy?

482
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,227
‐ Filed in a box somewhere.
‐ Mark, ambulance pulling up.

483
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,660
I'll take that,
besides, it's poorly written

484
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,593
endless psychobabble,
you'd be bored to tears.

485
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:06,193
I doubt it.

486
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:09,060
Carol.

487
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,327
Hey, I just got the labs
back on Joi Abbott.

488
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,727
Who?

489
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,293
The woman who fainted
in the cafeteria.

490
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,793
‐ She has microcytic anemia.
‐ Just give her some iron.

491
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:17,860
She'll be fine
in a couple weeks.

492
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:20,160
No, I doubt it.
Her son has ALD.

493
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,927
‐ How old is he?
‐ Eight. Why?

494
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,993
They usually don't make it
past the age of ten.

495
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,560
Well, when I pulled his chart,
he had an older brother

496
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,093
who died of it
three years ago.

497
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,860
Mmm, yeah, it's x‐linked.
Inherited from the mother.

498
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:30,327
It only strikes boys.

499
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,593
No wonder why Joi looks like
she's been through hell.

500
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:34,027
Simon says.

501
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,127
I can't believe
you paged me for this.

502
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,827
When a child acts
out it's usually

503
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,027
an indication
of a bigger problem.

504
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,693
If Reese bit a kid,
it's probably because

505
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,127
he was provoked.

506
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,760
Actually, this isn't
the first time

507
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:46,727
he's disrupted
the class.

508
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,827
Yesterday, Reese threw a fit
when it was sing‐along time

509
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,793
and he wanted
to continue painting.

510
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:54,860
Maybe that's because
he can't sing along.

511
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,260
I understand, but we
don't have the personnel

512
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:59,627
to let each child do
their own activities.

513
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,593
I already spend extra
time with Reese

514
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:02,860
talking to him and making
sure he understands.

515
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,760
Okay, okay, okay.

516
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:08,127
Listen. Listen, what do
you want me to do?

517
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,860
Perhaps you should consider
a special‐needs environment

518
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,727
where Reese can get
more personal attention.

519
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,727
I think it may be the
best for all concerned.

520
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,060
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

521
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,293
You're doing awesome, Robin.

522
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,227
Fetal heart tones
present at 140.

523
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,293
Okay, are you feeling
any pain here?

524
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,727
Only with the contractions.
Is our baby alright?

525
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,160
‐ So far, so good.
‐ 'Haemoglobin is 12.8.'

526
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:32,860
‐ What have we got?
‐ Robin Gambrell, 28 years old.

527
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,060
Restrained front seat passenger

528
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,627
involved in a two‐car MVA.

529
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,927
Full‐term pregnancy and
she's in active labor.

530
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,227
It was my fault.

531
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,893
I shouldn't have been
driving so fast.

532
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,760
Hey, they‐they just brought
in the other victim.

533
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:44,993
I think they
need you next door.

534
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:47,560
Okay.

535
00:20:47,593 --> 00:20:50,327
I hope that guy's okay.
I never saw him coming.

536
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,827
Okay, we're gonna have
to do a quick pelvic exam

537
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,160
before we bring
you up to OB.

538
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:55,660
Mike, did you
hurt your back?

539
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:56,860
What?
Oh, no, I'm okay.

540
00:20:56,893 --> 00:20:58,227
Don't worry
about me, baby.

541
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,893
Lydia, let's get a trauma
panel on Mr. Gambrell.

542
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,927
I wanna make sure he didn't
damage his kidneys.

543
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,593
Uh‐oh.
Here comes another one!

544
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:08,127
Okay, baby, breathe now.
Breathe through the pain.

545
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
'His name is Aaron Drane.
He's a private in the army.'

546
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,193
BP's down to 60.

547
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,627
Could be intra‐abdominal
hemorrhage.

548
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,127
I need the peritoneal
lavage kit.

549
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,560
‐ Prep the belly.
‐ Another two units of O‐neg.

550
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:19,060
‐ Squeeze it in.
‐ Heart rate's up to 130.

551
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:22,093
Hook up the adapter
to the syringe.

552
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:26,660
Okay, I'm in.

553
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,760
Pull back on the syringe.

554
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:30,060
Gross blood.

555
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:32,627
Oh, v‐fib.

556
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,860
'Crash cart.'

557
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:34,960
Charge to 200.

558
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,093
Clear!

559
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,327
Tony, do you know how
to navigate the internet?

560
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,693
My middle
initials are WWW.

561
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:46,793
I'm trying to
find an article

562
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,060
on the Cornell
medical school

563
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:51,893
journal website, and..

564
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,260
You got backslashes
instead of forward slashes.

565
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,193
Common beginner's mistake.

566
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,227
‐ Author's name?
‐ Uh, Amanda lee.

567
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
Subject would be phobias.

568
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,660
I got an A. W. Lee.
wrote something

569
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:06,160
called "Fearing Fear."

570
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,193
Could you print
that up for me?

571
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:08,693
Already did.

572
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,627
Listen, call down
to the library

573
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,293
and have them
send up any articles

574
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:14,993
by the same author.

575
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:17,127
Hey, for you, Dr. G.

576
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,227
One more time.
Charge to 50.

577
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,960
‐ Charging.
‐ Clear.

578
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:26,327
He's still asystole.

579
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,193
Me and some friends
were hanging out

580
00:22:28,227 --> 00:22:30,960
after my shift, uh,
when Robin called

581
00:22:30,993 --> 00:22:32,693
and told me that
her water broke.

582
00:22:33,674 --> 00:22:35,740
I kind of freaked out.

583
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:38,040
That's pretty common
with first‐time dads.

584
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:39,940
Mike's been working
doubles so he can take

585
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:41,640
time off after the baby's born.

586
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:44,007
Yeah, I don't want Robin
going through this alone.

587
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,674
Hmm, sounds like you're
gonna make great parents.

588
00:22:46,707 --> 00:22:48,107
That's a
good looking baby.

589
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,207
Placenta looks fine.
There's no abruption.

590
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,207
Thank you, God.

591
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,740
What's going on in there?

592
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:56,840
How's the other driver doing?

593
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,707
Everything's fine, baby.

594
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,774
Don't worry.

595
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,807
'"This time, with
the wind aft, and a good one'

596
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,574
the swallow fairly raced
to the island, with her wig‐‐"

597
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,507
Hi, Joi.

598
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,807
Oh, hi.

599
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Sorry, I couldn't
make it back down.

600
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:18,607
That's okay, I decided
to come to you instead.

601
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,540
‐ That's nice of you.
‐ This must be Ricky.

602
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:21,874
I'm Carol.

603
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:23,640
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

604
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:25,907
He just started having trouble
talking a few days ago.

605
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,640
He used to be
such a chatterbox.

606
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,040
So, I got some
terrible disease, too?

607
00:23:32,074 --> 00:23:35,074
No, but your blood test
confirmed that you're anemic.

608
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:37,140
So, I brought you these
iron pills, if you take those

609
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,640
three times a day,
you'll feel a lot better.

610
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:41,640
And I would like you
to come back to the ER clinic

611
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:43,640
in three weeks so
I can recheck your blood.

612
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,140
I'll try. It's hard for me
to plan that far ahead.

613
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,640
Time to eat.
I've got chocolate today.

614
00:23:51,074 --> 00:23:53,207
Do you have
any help with Ricky?

615
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,140
My daughter Celia
plays with him sometimes.

616
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,874
'No, I was actually
thinking more medically.'

617
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,840
Uh...I take care
of all that.

618
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,907
You know, I could arrange
for some respite care.

619
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,240
Someone who could watch
Ricky a couple hours a day..

620
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:08,740
...while you
regain your strength.

621
00:24:08,774 --> 00:24:12,074
I appreciate the offer but
Ricky's my responsibility.

622
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,107
Joi, if you don't start
taking care of yourself

623
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,607
you're not gonna be
very much help to him

624
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,774
or your daughter, either.

625
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,774
It's my job to
see him through this.

626
00:24:40,774 --> 00:24:42,607
Good effort
in there, Amanda.

627
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,907
You win some,
you lose some.

628
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,674
Oh, you know, I was trying
to find your journal article

629
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:51,140
and I came up with this,
written by A. W. Lee

630
00:24:51,174 --> 00:24:52,840
picture of
a 40 year old Asian guy.

631
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:55,140
Yeah, and who was
a classmate of mine at Cornell.

632
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:57,874
And not a very good one,
I might add.

633
00:24:57,907 --> 00:24:59,974
People were constantly
getting us mixed up.

634
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:02,240
So, you wrote the article,
but they printed his photo.

635
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah, they printed
a correction in the next issue

636
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:06,174
but by then,
the damage was done.

637
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:07,907
‐ And this is on the internet.
‐ Yeah.

638
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,174
A global source
of misinformation.

639
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:13,140
Hey, Tony, why don't
you get the, uh, editor

640
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:15,074
of the Cornell journal
of medicine for me?

641
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,940
Mark, it's really
not necessary.

642
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,540
You should get credit
for your work, Amanda.

643
00:25:19,574 --> 00:25:21,207
Where's Cornell?

644
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,074
‐ Yes, officer?
‐ I'm following up on the MVA.

645
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,174
I wanted to know
how everyone was doing.

646
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,274
Yeah, Mrs. Gambrell
and the baby

647
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:31,907
are doing fine.

648
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,907
Unfortunately, the driver
of the other car expired.

649
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,574
And, uh,
Michael Gambrell

650
00:25:39,607 --> 00:25:41,007
the driver who
caused the accident?

651
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,274
Just some minor cuts
and abrasions.

652
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,774
We have some witnesses saying
he was driving erratically.

653
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:46,907
Did you get a blood
alcohol on him?

654
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,240
Uh, just a CBC
and a chem panel.

655
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,807
Can you get
a BAL off that?

656
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,807
I‐I really don't think
that's necessary.

657
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,640
It's standard procedure.

658
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:57,540
Now, I can take him
down to the station.

659
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:58,974
I'll add it
to his orders.

660
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,874
Appreciate it.

661
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,940
Just try
and relax, Mr. Wong.

662
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,640
Pulse ox 87.

663
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:08,807
I can't find
the radial artery.

664
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,074
Try a brachial stick.

665
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,940
Got a pulse.

666
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,040
Mr. Wong, I'm going
to stick you now.

667
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,540
Okay?

668
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,507
I'm getting blood.

669
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,807
You see? All it takes
is a little practice.

670
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,040
Ow!

671
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:29,040
‐ Lily, take over for Lucy.
‐ Dr. Carter.

672
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:30,240
Go to the suture room,
flush out the wound.

673
00:26:30,274 --> 00:26:31,474
I'll be right there.

674
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:34,874
Lucy.

675
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,874
Well, sounds like
an astronaut to me.

676
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:43,607
It's not like I'm
gonna fly the thing.

677
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,707
So, what's a payload
specialist do, anyway?

678
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,174
Onboard experiments.

679
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:48,840
This guy I went to
school with is heading up

680
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,207
a medical team
for next year

681
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,807
and just wanted to see
if I was interested.

682
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,874
That's some pretty intense
physical training, right?

683
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:55,640
Are you saying, I'm not
gonna be physically in shape?

684
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:57,540
Hey, you know they let
John Glenn back up there

685
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,507
and he's what?
Like, in his late '70s.

686
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,507
Thanks, Carol.

687
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:02,774
Yeah, sounds like
the opportunity

688
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,207
of a lifetime, you know?

689
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,907
It's not like you have
Rachel and Jen to tie you down.

690
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,174
Tie him down?

691
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:09,540
It's not like I was
looking for it.

692
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:10,674
It just kind of found me.

693
00:27:10,707 --> 00:27:13,507
Yo, Dr. G!

694
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,140
Those A. W. Lee
articles you wanted?

695
00:27:15,174 --> 00:27:16,507
They're checked out.

696
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,907
All of them?
By who?

697
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,740
‐ Didn't ask.
‐ When were they checked out?

698
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:21,240
Didn't ask.

699
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,707
Did that editor from
Cornell return my call?

700
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,874
Nah.

701
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:26,140
Listen, check with
the library

702
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:28,040
and see what else
you can find out.

703
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:29,874
Donald, can I talk to you?

704
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,007
‐ I'm late for surgery, Mark.
‐ It'll just take a second.

705
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,574
You know anybody over
at the Cornell medical school?

706
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,774
Hmm, can't say that I do.

707
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:36,840
Why don't you talk to Dr. Lee?

708
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:38,074
That's her Alma Mater.

709
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:39,940
You never spoke to
anybody there about her?

710
00:27:39,974 --> 00:27:41,607
I didn't see the need.

711
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,107
You saw her letters
of recommendation.

712
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
‐ They were glowing.
‐ Yes. Yes, they were.

713
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:47,607
An old army buddy
of mine who worked with her

714
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,907
in Atlanta said that she was
the best resident he's ever had.

715
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,240
Really?
That's good to hear.

716
00:27:51,274 --> 00:27:53,140
‐ If there's a problem..
‐ No, no, no problem.

717
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:55,007
Sorry to bother you.

718
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,140
CT just called.

719
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,974
They're ready
for the freaky chica.

720
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,207
Why don't you stick with me?

721
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,074
I may need your
transpo expertise.

722
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,540
Lucy.
I'm so sorry.

723
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:10,874
It's okay.
It was an accident.

724
00:28:10,907 --> 00:28:12,174
No, I should have
warned the patient

725
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,007
that I was gonna
stick him.

726
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,074
Like you said,
risk comes with the job.

727
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:19,740
‐ Uh, let me see.
‐ What do I do?

728
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,274
We're gonna send a sample
of the patient's blood

729
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:23,674
down to the lab
for a rapid HIV test.

730
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:25,040
Can we do that without
his permission?

731
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,974
Yes, since we already
have a sample.

732
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,607
Let me take a look.

733
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,774
And if he turns out
to be HIV‐positive

734
00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:34,807
which I'm sure he won't

735
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,107
then we'll tell him
the test results.

736
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,707
And if he's positive I'm gonna
have to start prophylaxis.

737
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,074
Well, let's just take
this one step at a time.

738
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:45,640
Okay?

739
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:46,907
Okay.

740
00:28:50,574 --> 00:28:51,807
Hasn't the interpreter
arrived yet?

741
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,140
The nurse says she's busy

742
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:55,207
another one is
driving in from somewhere.

743
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,074
Okay, we really shouldn't
wait on this.

744
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,207
She said okay.

745
00:29:06,007 --> 00:29:07,207
Grandma wants to watch.

746
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,007
No. No. No.
That's not necessary.

747
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:12,807
Okay. Okay. Fine.

748
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,540
I love you.

749
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:18,940
'I love you both.'

750
00:29:21,974 --> 00:29:23,507
Okay, we're gonna be
in and out of there

751
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,907
in less than 20 minutes.

752
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,774
‐ Don't leave.
‐ Don't worry, I'm right here.

753
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,174
‐ How does it look, Tony?
‐ Coast is clear, captain.

754
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:31,740
Alright, Edie,
why don't you

755
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:34,074
close your eyes and
imagine yourself in..

756
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,074
‐ How about outer space?
‐ What?

757
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,674
Yeah, you know, you're floating
around the galaxy

758
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,040
in the black expanse

759
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:44,040
and Earth is a tiny speck
in the distance, okay?

760
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,274
‐ Are there cookies?
‐ Cookies? Sure. Yeah.

761
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:47,774
You can eat cookies
in outer space.

762
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:48,940
Wash them down
with Tang.

763
00:29:48,974 --> 00:29:50,207
'Coming through!

764
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,874
'I need blood now!'

765
00:29:51,907 --> 00:29:53,274
Don't...make me.

766
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:54,940
‐ Can't...Can't...
‐ Let's go back. Go back.

767
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:57,507
We're gonna go back.
Alright.

768
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,574
Well, let's take her back.

769
00:29:58,607 --> 00:29:59,607
We're gonna take you back.

770
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,807
We're gonna take you back.

771
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:06,507
Excuse me, we've been
waiting for over 45 minutes

772
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,940
and no one will
tell us about our son.

773
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,774
I'm sorry, I'm sure
the doctor's tied up.

774
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,774
I don't want your damn excuses.
I wanna know about my son.

775
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:13,507
Why can't we see him?
What's going on?

776
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,140
What's your son's name?

777
00:30:15,174 --> 00:30:17,874
Aaron Drane.
He's a private in the US Army.

778
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:19,807
He was in a car accident.

779
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,007
Well, I'm not
aware of his status.

780
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
But let me see
what I can find out.

781
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,174
He was just home on leave.

782
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:24,574
He was driving
back to base.

783
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:25,974
Look, we're gonna
go back there.

784
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:27,040
‐ You can't stop us.
‐ Just wait one minute.

785
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:29,107
Excuse me,
Mr. Drane, uh..

786
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,774
Mrs. Drane,
I'm officer Moore.

787
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,207
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you this

788
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,507
but your son, Aaron,
was very seriously injured

789
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,574
and he died.

790
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,874
The doctors here did everything
they could to save him.

791
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,174
Hi, Amanda.
What are you doing in here?

792
00:30:54,207 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm cutting out some fascinating
articles on Conn's syndrome.

793
00:30:58,074 --> 00:31:00,007
Aren't those
hospital copies?

794
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,840
Yeah.
They were extras.

795
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:04,540
You know what? Unfortunately,
I have to cancel on tonight.

796
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:06,174
There's a killer migraine
that's like a freight train

797
00:31:06,207 --> 00:31:07,740
running through my head.

798
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:09,074
Oh, have you ever
tried just pressing?

799
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:10,774
You name it,
I've tried it.

800
00:31:10,807 --> 00:31:12,774
I think the best thing
for me is just to go home

801
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:15,607
and pull the covers
up over my head.

802
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,740
But Mark and I will
definitely reschedule, okay?

803
00:31:17,774 --> 00:31:19,740
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

804
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,274
Oh, Dr. Weaver.

805
00:31:22,307 --> 00:31:24,807
Um, Mike Gambrell's
blood alcohol came back.

806
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
‐ "0.086."
‐ Just over the limit.

807
00:31:26,874 --> 00:31:28,740
‐ Not good, huh?
‐ No. Not good at all.

808
00:31:28,774 --> 00:31:29,907
I am okay.

809
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,040
Nothing bad can happen to me.

810
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:33,740
‐ I am in control.
‐ That's it.

811
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:36,540
Just keep nice,
positive thoughts.

812
00:31:36,574 --> 00:31:38,774
‐ That's good.
‐ I am...I am in control.

813
00:31:38,807 --> 00:31:41,907
‐ I am okay.
‐ How weird is that?

814
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,707
‐ What?
‐ Uh, nothing. Nothing.

815
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,074
We're just gonna, uh,
wait for the next elevator

816
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:47,640
'cause this one's full.

817
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,807
Alright, there it is.

818
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,640
One inflamed appy
with fibrinous exudate.

819
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:55,874
You know, I've never
come across a deaf doctor.

820
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:58,107
Quite an amazing feat
that she's pulled off.

821
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,007
Alright, preparing to clamp.

822
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,807
How did she manage
a residency?

823
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,740
Especially a surgical rotation?

824
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:05,607
A mask on,
her hands occupied.

825
00:32:08,074 --> 00:32:09,874
Don't worry.
She can't read our lips.

826
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah, but still,
it's rude to talk about her

827
00:32:11,274 --> 00:32:12,607
when she's standing
right in front of us.

828
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:16,674
You're absolutely right.

829
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,207
My apologies.

830
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,507
Where you been?

831
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,740
Phone's been ringing
off the hook.

832
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,640
Helping Dr. G,
get a patient to CT.

833
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,607
And let me tell you,
it was no picnic.

834
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,940
Oh, he wanted
this Cornell call.

835
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:29,107
Wonder if maybe I
should run it up to him?

836
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,574
I'm heading that way.

837
00:32:30,607 --> 00:32:31,907
I owe you one.

838
00:32:35,074 --> 00:32:36,540
Look, he had
a couple of beers

839
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:38,507
with no intention
of driving

840
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,240
and then, his wife
called in labor.

841
00:32:40,274 --> 00:32:41,840
He killed a man.
That's involuntary manslaughter.

842
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:43,007
Yes and he's willing
to take

843
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,874
full responsibility
for his actions.

844
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:47,574
He just wants to stay with
his wife through the delivery.

845
00:32:47,607 --> 00:32:49,074
Look, I don't like this
any more than you do

846
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:50,707
but my job is to
arrest him now.

847
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,140
Yeah, but should
his wife and child

848
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:53,540
have to pay as well?

849
00:32:58,574 --> 00:32:59,940
Alright, he can stay
until she delivers

850
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:01,107
but then I'm
taking him in.

851
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,740
Thank you.
Thanks.

852
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:07,674
Great news. Mr. Wong's
test results came back.

853
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:09,774
‐ He's negative.
‐ Are you sure?

854
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,940
I went to the lab myself
to confirm the results.

855
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,674
Thank you.
Thank you.

856
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:16,107
‐ Thank you so much, um..
‐ Don't thank me.

857
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm the one that
got you into this.

858
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:18,640
Oh, well,
I appreciate you

859
00:33:18,674 --> 00:33:19,940
sticking through it
with me.

860
00:33:19,974 --> 00:33:21,507
I still want you
to get tested again.

861
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,274
Six months, just to
be on the safe side.

862
00:33:23,307 --> 00:33:25,274
Absolutely.

863
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,907
Oh, man,
I'm so relieved.

864
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,474
Tell me about it.

865
00:33:31,607 --> 00:33:33,974
‐ Done?
‐ You passed with flying colors.

866
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,507
I'll be right in.

867
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,807
Why don't you go ahead
and process those?

868
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,874
I am okay.

869
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:48,040
Yes, you are.

870
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:49,274
'And the scan confirmed that'

871
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,040
'there's no bleeding
in the brain.'

872
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,874
'Oh, Edie, if you want
me to unstrap you'

873
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,807
you're gonna have to
let go of my hand.

874
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,074
I thought you were different.

875
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:03,607
I thought you
understood the real me.

876
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,107
Obviously,
I was mistaken.

877
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,707
Amanda, what's going on?

878
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Unstrap.

879
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,774
I'm a fine Dr. Mark.
I have what it takes.

880
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:14,007
I know that.

881
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,574
‐ Then why did you doubt me?
‐ No!

882
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,874
If this is about the
article, we can talk.

883
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,207
‐ Why is this door locked?
‐ The door's locked?

884
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,007
I loved you more
than any man

885
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,240
has a right to be loved.

886
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,007
What?

887
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,840
'I never expected
to feel like this.'

888
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:31,807
I hate feeling like this!

889
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Amanda, I don't know
what you're talking about!

890
00:34:33,874 --> 00:34:35,274
If you just open this door..

891
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:36,840
Please!

892
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,974
It's too painful for me
to be near you right now.

893
00:34:40,007 --> 00:34:42,140
Can we talk about this?

894
00:34:42,174 --> 00:34:43,874
No.

895
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,207
'Can't...can't breathe!'

896
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,540
It's okay, it's alright.

897
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:48,740
It's okay, Edie.
Just keep breathing.

898
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:49,774
Keep breathing.

899
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:51,674
Amanda, I wanna understand.

900
00:34:51,707 --> 00:34:53,207
It's too late
for that, Mark.

901
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,774
It's over.

902
00:34:58,774 --> 00:35:00,674
But I will never forget you.

903
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:07,274
'Amanda, wait!'

904
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,674
Amanda, wait!
Let us out of here!

905
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,274
'Dying!'

906
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:14,707
It's okay.
Okay. Okay.

907
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:20,609
They were locked
in there how long?

908
00:35:20,642 --> 00:35:22,109
Over an hour.

909
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,342
The tech decided
to take a long lunch.

910
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:24,875
Have they found Dr. Lee yet?

911
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,009
‐ Missing in action.
‐ Get this.

912
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,975
Amanda Lee, also
known as Barbara Hardin

913
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:30,842
also known
as Janice Englehart.

914
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,442
She never even got her MD.

915
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,475
‐ She's not a real doctor?
‐ Unbelievable.

916
00:35:34,509 --> 00:35:35,942
From what they
can tell she stole

917
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:38,142
A.W. Lee's medical
school transcripts

918
00:35:38,175 --> 00:35:40,009
and used them to get
into a residency program.

919
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,209
Why didn't I
think of that?

920
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,209
It's not her
first time, either.

921
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:44,842
According to her
records, she also posed

922
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,475
as a lawyer
and an architect.

923
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:48,175
Do you know how many
patients she treated?

924
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,275
Hospital's gonna have a
liability nightmare.

925
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:51,309
Can't believe,
I thought she was

926
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:52,342
such a good doctor.

927
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:53,509
Certainly had me fooled.

928
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:54,509
Me, too.

929
00:35:57,475 --> 00:36:00,042
Wonder if my Portland
job offer was made up, too?

930
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,209
What job offer?

931
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:06,475
‐ Edie?
‐ Oh, Dr. Greene.

932
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:08,509
I wanna thank you.

933
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,042
For what? Getting you held
hostage by a crazed lunatic?

934
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:13,875
Oh, I haven't..

935
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:15,509
I haven't felt
this good in years.

936
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,909
That's great.

937
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,275
Yeah, I mean, if I can

938
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,275
survive this hellhole

939
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:21,542
I can survive anything.

940
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,575
Can I call you a cab?

941
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:26,075
No.
No, no.

942
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,475
I think, I'm just
gonna walk.

943
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:35,209
Cervix is at
seven centimeters.

944
00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:36,442
Shouldn't be long.

945
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:38,175
We'll get you
upstairs right now.

946
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:39,875
‐ Is that him? Is that the guy?
‐ Yes, yes.

947
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:41,109
Excuse me, I'm treating
a patient here.

948
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:42,375
That son of a bitch
killed my son.

949
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,275
Oh, my God.

950
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:45,909
I'm sorry.

951
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,942
You gotta believe me.
I didn't mean for this.

952
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:49,975
What are you waiting for?
Arrest him.

953
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,009
Baby's heart rate is slowing.

954
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,342
Okay, let's get in‐‐

955
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,509
‐ Mike, don't leave me.
‐ I'm right here, baby.

956
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,142
He just wants to see his wife
through labor, alright.

957
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,509
'I'll stay with him.
He only needs a few more hours.'

958
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,575
I would have liked
a few more hours with my son.

959
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:04,975
I've got to do this.

960
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,009
Mr. Gambrell, you should
go with the officer.

961
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,242
'You can post bail.'

962
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,442
Hopefully you'll be back
before the birth.

963
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:15,975
I‐I'm not leaving.

964
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,175
I think you have to.

965
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:19,175
No, he doesn't.

966
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:20,975
We're gonna take
very good care of her.

967
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:42,242
Yeah, uh‐huh.

968
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,242
Um...good pick up.

969
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:47,442
So how do you think
she's gotten away

970
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:49,042
with this charade
for so long?

971
00:37:49,075 --> 00:37:53,042
Obviously, Dr. Lee's
a first‐class pathological liar.

972
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:55,442
ER, if you're sick,
we'll fix you quick.

973
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:02,609
Hey, Dale.

974
00:38:06,475 --> 00:38:08,242
Listen, um..

975
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:09,475
Lucy's a good kid.

976
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:11,575
So...try to be nice.

977
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,442
John, I'm always nice.

978
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:16,375
She told me about
getting needle‐stuck.

979
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:18,942
The guy tested
HIV‐negative, right?

980
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:21,142
‐ Yeah, thank god.
‐ I'll say.

981
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,009
Means I got a chance at
scoring tonight after all.

982
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,875
Dr. Carter do you
have a lucky number

983
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,409
you want me to bet on?

984
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:28,609
No, thanks.

985
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,109
Not feeling
very lucky tonight.

986
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,842
I am.

987
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:32,975
Shall we, Lucy?

988
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:34,009
Bye.

989
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:39,142
'Yes, if I must.'

990
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:43,242
'I'm trying to
apprise the CEO'

991
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,475
about Dr. Lee

992
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:46,575
and he keeps
putting me on hold.

993
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,542
I thought you should know, uh

994
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:51,009
a patient died under
hers and my care today.

995
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,542
Well, that's just what
I didn't need to hear.

996
00:38:56,575 --> 00:39:00,309
However, I...I don't believe
either of us made any errors.

997
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:01,842
Well, I'm sure
the hospital attorneys

998
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,475
will wanna speak
to you about it.

999
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:05,909
I've also been
thinking about

1000
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,442
what you said
earlier and, um..

1001
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:12,242
I intend to pursue
the publication of my paper.

1002
00:39:12,275 --> 00:39:15,075
Yes, yes, I'm here.
Can you hold one second, please?

1003
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:19,609
Well, in light of
the Amanda Lee debacle

1004
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,942
it's obvious none of us
are above reproach.

1005
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:25,542
I admire your directness.

1006
00:39:28,209 --> 00:39:30,342
Alright, give me a list of the
journals you'd like to submit to

1007
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,042
and I'll attach
a cover letter.

1008
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,575
Thank you, Donald.

1009
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:38,175
Yeah.
Where were we?

1010
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,242
‐ How we doing?
‐ She's crowning.

1011
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:43,442
Mike's not gonna
make it, is he?

1012
00:39:43,475 --> 00:39:46,842
No, but we're gonna get
through this, Robin, okay?

1013
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,475
Now, take a deep
breath and push.

1014
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,942
There you go.

1015
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:52,375
I'm beginning to
guide the head out.

1016
00:39:52,409 --> 00:39:54,275
Deep breath...
and push again.

1017
00:39:56,175 --> 00:39:57,942
Mark's made some bad
choices in women before

1018
00:39:57,975 --> 00:39:59,842
but I think he
outdid himself this time.

1019
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,409
I knew there was
something off about her.

1020
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:04,161
I don't wanna
talk about it.

1021
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,057
Can I just ask
you a question?

1022
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,157
Was the fire escape
thing for real?

1023
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,157
What fire escape?

1024
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,057
‐ Never mind.
‐ Uh‐oh.

1025
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,957
Think we should open it?

1026
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,724
Hmm, too thin
to be a bomb.

1027
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:18,890
What is it?

1028
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:20,590
"This is for you,
it is a poem

1029
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,090
"you inspired me to write.

1030
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:24,757
"Because two bodies,
naked and entwined

1031
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,057
"leap over time,
they are invulnerable.

1032
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,957
"Nothing can touch them.

1033
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,224
‐ "They return to the source.
‐ "They return to the source.

1034
00:40:30,257 --> 00:40:33,257
‐ "There's no you, no I
‐ "There's no you, no I

1035
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,090
‐ No tomorrow."
‐ No tomorrow."

1036
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:38,157
Octavio Paz,
my favorite poet.

1037
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:43,124
There you go.

1038
00:40:43,157 --> 00:40:45,124
Looks like you inspired
her to plagiarize.

1039
00:40:45,157 --> 00:40:46,224
Just go.

1040
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,757
So, dinner for three?

1041
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,124
I'm gonna hit the gym first.

1042
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:56,314
Carol...I thought
I'd missed you.

1043
00:40:56,348 --> 00:40:58,214
Hey, Joi,
is something wrong?

1044
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,314
I've been thinking
about what you said

1045
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,016
about respite care.

1046
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,782
And my daughter has
her dance recital next week.

1047
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:06,049
I mean, I know it
would mean a lot to her

1048
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:07,616
if I was there.

1049
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:08,982
Of course, I'll make
some calls first thing

1050
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:10,449
in the morning
and find someone to help.

1051
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:11,482
I appreciate that.

1052
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:12,516
Hey, kiddo, how you doing?

1053
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:14,916
‐ Fine.
‐ Yeah?

1054
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:16,682
He's got a little
conjunctivitis in his left eye.

1055
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:18,516
Oh, I meant to have the doctor
upstairs take a look

1056
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:19,949
but there were
so many tests.

1057
00:41:19,982 --> 00:41:22,149
It's alright, I'll write a
prescription for gentamicin.

1058
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:23,182
We'll get him
cleared right up.

1059
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:24,782
Okay.

1060
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,716
Well, this is getting
a little ridiculous.

1061
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,882
I was coming by to see
how the Gambrell wife

1062
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:45,016
and baby are doing.

1063
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:46,182
According to Dr. Weaver

1064
00:41:46,216 --> 00:41:47,849
both mother
and daughter are fine.

1065
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:50,882
Well, I'll call in and
have them tell the dad.

1066
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:53,682
It's a shame, really.
He was not a bad guy.

1067
00:41:53,716 --> 00:41:56,582
He just made one
really dumb mistake.

1068
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,982
Yeah, you're right.
It is a shame.

1069
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:02,849
You have
a good one, Jeanie.

1070
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:05,049
‐ Hey, Reggie.
‐ Hmm?

1071
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:06,882
Look, I've got
plans for tonight but

1072
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:08,649
you wanna catch
a movie tomorrow night?

1073
00:42:10,616 --> 00:42:11,816
Let me think about it.

1074
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:15,416
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

1075
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:18,716
‐ Goodnight.
‐ Goodnight.

1076
00:42:25,016 --> 00:42:26,716
‐ Hey, Dr. Weaver.
‐ Hey.

1077
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:32,682
‐ INH.
‐ Oh, you converted, huh?

1078
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,582
Hey, your mom, she, uh,
she never called back.

1079
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:37,582
My mom's dead.

1080
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:40,649
Uh, I‐I was adopted.

1081
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:43,116
Possible that call
was from my birth mother.

1082
00:42:43,149 --> 00:42:46,149
Wow.
I, uh, I didn't know.

1083
00:42:46,182 --> 00:42:48,549
Yeah, well, probably
a wrong number

1084
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,782
so, false alarm.

1085
00:42:50,816 --> 00:42:52,449
Have you been looking for her?

1086
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,582
I put my name on the
internet about a month ago.

1087
00:42:56,249 --> 00:42:59,149
My parents,
my‐my adopted parents

1088
00:42:59,182 --> 00:43:01,649
have been gone
about a year now, so..

1089
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:03,749
Well, I would think that there'd
be agencies that‐‐

1090
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,149
Yeah.
Yeah, there are.

1091
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,582
There are.

1092
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:12,182
Go on,
it's Friday night.

1093
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:15,482
Yeah, I'm gonna miss
my curtain if I don't move it.

1094
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:17,416
‐ Have a good time.
‐ 'Hey, thanks.'

1095
00:43:21,149 --> 00:43:23,816
'Good, hey.'

1096
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,782
Hey.

1097
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:29,482
Hey.

1098
00:43:29,516 --> 00:43:31,482
What's happening, Reese?

1099
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:32,549
Huh?

1100
00:43:34,482 --> 00:43:35,816
What?

1101
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:40,516
Hey, hey, hey.

1102
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:42,082
You know who I am?

1103
00:43:42,116 --> 00:43:44,082
Huh?
Reese, you know who I am?

1104
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:46,116
Who am I? Huh?

1105
00:43:46,149 --> 00:43:49,182
Can you say "Father?"

1106
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:51,782
Come on, man.
Let me show you. Look.

1107
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:53,016
Can you say "Daddy?"

1108
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,682
'Huh?'

1109
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,482
Yes, see what
I learned, "Daddy."

1110
00:43:56,516 --> 00:43:57,582
See, "Daddy?"

1111
00:43:57,616 --> 00:44:00,182
Come on, Reese.

1112
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,682
Eh...never mind.

1113
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:07,549
Yeah.
Hey..

1114
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:10,816
Hey, man.

1115
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:20,949
Hey, that's it.
