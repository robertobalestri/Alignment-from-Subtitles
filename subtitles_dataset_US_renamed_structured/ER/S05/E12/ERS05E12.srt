1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
Previously, on "ER."

2
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:08,366
You wanna catch
a movie tomorrow?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,733
Okay.

4
00:00:09,766 --> 00:00:11,600
You actually applied
to the space program?

5
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:13,066
My second year
of residency.

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,600
Tonight's dinner
is semi‐formal

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:18,133
so, uh, any slinky
black number will do.

8
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,100
So, you want me to conduct
a study at County General.

9
00:00:21,133 --> 00:00:23,166
And the drug is for the
treatment of fracture pain?

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,800
Mm‐hmm, comparing it against
acetaminophen with codeine.

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,633
Joi, what's your son's
medical condition?

12
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,500
ALD, adrenoleukodystrophy.

13
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:31,266
‐ How old is he?
‐ Eight, why?

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,066
They usually don't make
it past the age of ten.

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,666
‐ This must be Ricky, I'm Carol.
‐ Hi.

16
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:45,366
You know, I could've just taken
Lucy out for a pizza.

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,166
That's what all
my residents did for me

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,400
when I finished a rotation.

19
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,600
No, in my day,
residents always had

20
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,766
their students
over for a meal.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,566
Makes for better mentoring.

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,333
That's why I invited
Peter Benton to join us.

23
00:00:58,366 --> 00:00:59,433
‐ Dr. Benton's coming?
‐ 'Sure.'

24
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,500
He was your resident.

25
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,633
Now Lucy's working with him.

26
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,766
It's much more civilized to..

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,533
John, no!
No, no, no, no.

28
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,100
I thought the peppers
went in the blender.

29
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,400
No, we want separate colors
for the sauce.

30
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,533
‐ Good save.
‐ Yeah.

31
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:13,100
You cool
and peel them first.

32
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:15,800
Why don't you seed
the Persian cukes?

33
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,266
You know, it's funny.

34
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,666
I'm actually gonna miss
havin' Lucy around.

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,300
That's how it works.

36
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,300
The instant, students know
enough to be of use

37
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,466
they move to
another rotation.

38
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Okay, lengthwise,
lengthwise.

39
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:31,300
‐ Oops.
‐ Yeah.

40
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:32,533
Lengthwise.

41
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,733
And then you
seed them, okay?

42
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,733
You know, emergency
medicine may not be

43
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,233
a bad choice for Lucy.

44
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,633
Well, she might
feel differently

45
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,433
after she has her
surgical rotation.

46
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,366
You know what,
why don't you..

47
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,466
...why don't you chill
the Pinot Grigio?

48
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,766
In the, uh,
in the freezer?

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,766
Keep your day job, Carter.

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,166
Let's see how
you handle these.

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,500
Got it?

52
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,766
Alright, let's do it.

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,333
Do you have inside
information on this new drug?

54
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:08,666
This stuff really
works well for him?

55
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,433
Oh, it's amazing,
Aaron broke his arm

56
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,700
a couple of years ago,
the pain was excruciating.

57
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,100
But, this, I'd like
to buy stock in it.

58
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,400
"This" may just be
acetaminophen with codeine.

59
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,066
No way, I‐I know
that some patients

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,533
in the study aren't
getting the wonder drug

61
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,700
but Aaron is
and it's remarkable stuff.

62
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,366
They really keep
you docs in the dark?

63
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,166
Yeah, it's a double‐blind study
so, you're gonna have

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,166
to get your insider trading
from somebody else.

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,233
‐ See you in three weeks.
‐ See you in three weeks.

66
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,033
Hey, Doug, Jeanie called.
She's gonna be late.

67
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,133
‐ Probably stuck in the snow.
‐ Actually, she overslept.

68
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,033
‐ Had a late night.
‐ I wish we'd overslept.

69
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,500
We are going to kick‐start
the A. M. with a wake‐up call

70
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,733
from my main men,
Hetfield and Hammett.

71
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,700
Lynette, I didn't
expect to see you today.

72
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,366
‐ The clinic's closed.
‐ Oh.

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,600
I, uh, organized a seminar
on STD's and cervical cancer.

74
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,066
Kind of like a gab session
for the women in the community.

75
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
Oh, that's a great idea.

76
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,200
Is that Metallica?

77
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,433
Lynette, you're a metalhead?

78
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,733
‐ You know this tune?
‐ Yeah.

79
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:01,200
'Cause it's banned
in my house.

80
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,233
Well, I thought that,
you know, women should

81
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,066
know more about screening
and prevention.

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,233
Oh, absolutely. I just, I wish
I could pay you overtime.

83
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,566
Oh, don't worry about it.

84
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,633
I scored some grant money
to pay for it.

85
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,133
‐ Really?
‐ Uh‐huh.

86
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,566
It's going to run
through the clinic?

87
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,100
Yeah, I got lucky.

88
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:17,066
Caught some dribbles
off the gravy train.

89
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,600
Mark.

90
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,533
‐ I thought that was you.
‐ Hi, Donald.

91
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:27,700
Listen, I got your, uh,
memo about the NASA offer.

92
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,600
Yeah, opportunity
just came out of the blue.

93
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,733
It's a full year
of training in Houston?

94
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:34,433
Yeah, it could be 18 months
if they delay the launch.

95
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,433
‐ Don't do it.
‐ What?

96
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, I mean, obviously,
do what you must

97
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,300
but I wish you wouldn't.

98
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,100
You kept me awake
last night.

99
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:43,133
I kept you awake?

100
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,733
I do not want to run
the emergency department

101
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,033
without you.

102
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:48,633
What'll it take
to get you to stay?

103
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,700
Uh, full tenure,
effective today.

104
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,266
Well, I probably
can't swing that

105
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,233
but I, uh, I could
push up your eligibility

106
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,800
consider you in 0‐2.

107
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,366
2002?

108
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,266
Or two? Is somebody
going to tell us

109
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,366
what to call the future
or is it every man for himself?

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,133
You'd consider me
for tenure

111
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,433
in three years?

112
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:07,566
We need you.

113
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,733
Think about it.

114
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,166
'I think you have
a flair for this.'

115
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
Yes, I think I've found
my niche, pulling drains.

116
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,133
Just make sure you
get the penrose

117
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,266
and not the t‐tube.

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Pull that,
it's not a pretty sight.

119
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,733
Ah, Ms. Knight, I see you
found your way to Dr. Corday.

120
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,433
Absolutely,
all the pre‐op labs

121
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,600
were in the charts
when I arrived.

122
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,200
‐ I nearly kissed her.
‐ Oh.

123
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,366
No, None of that,
not unless I get to watch.

124
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,533
I, uh, insisted
that you get a decent student.

125
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,500
I knew that you could use
some backup with the scut.

126
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,633
And I live for scut.

127
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,500
If Ms. Knight actually helps
you get finished early

128
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,800
I'd like you to assist
this afternoon

129
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,466
on a choledochojejunostomy.

130
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,766
Choledochojejunostomy?

131
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,666
Well, you can say it.

132
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,633
Would you like to do it?

133
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,300
I'm waiting for the
other shoe to drop.

134
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,533
No, no catch.
You've suffered enough.

135
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,233
'I started the groundwork
today to see'

136
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,800
if we can't get
your fellowship reinstated.

137
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,600
You deserve it.

138
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:48,766
Well, I'll be damned.

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,066
So, should I feel special

140
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,200
or does he stare
at everyone's breasts?

141
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:56,400
No, only the females.

142
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:58,233
As far as I know.

143
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,533
'Well, if it's good
for the clinic.'

144
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,133
It's your clinic,
You have the right to know

145
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,800
what grants are applied
for in its name.

146
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,600
Yeah, but Lynette does
have some good ideas.

147
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:06,466
And you are the boss.
You get to say yes or no.

148
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,066
Jerry, what the
hell is that?

149
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,733
That is part of our
new music program.

150
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,233
Really, you call
that music?

151
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,133
I told you to start
with Erykah Badu.

152
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,033
It's for the patients in chairs.

153
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,166
Music helps people handle
the stress of waiting.

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,166
I thought you were getting
ready to DJ a party.

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,033
That's just a coincidence.
Somebody signed off on this.

156
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,166
‐ Who signed off on this?
‐ Dr. Lee.

157
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,766
Jerry, there is no Dr. Lee.
There never was a Dr. Lee.

158
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,333
Is that siren in the music or is
there an ambulance pulling up?

159
00:06:30,366 --> 00:06:31,500
It's in the music.

160
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:33,733
We could use some help here.

161
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:36,166
Jerry, turn the music down
and give Connie and me a hand.

162
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,566
Oh, boy.
Gird your loins.

163
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,633
36‐year‐old woman found down
at the scene of a kitchen fire.

164
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:46,600
‐ This is one big woman.
‐ Probable anaphylaxis.

165
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,266
Her med‐alert bracelet
said peanut allergy.

166
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
Gave her ten of valium
and tubed her.

167
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,466
Alright, don't pull
until we get a good grip.

168
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,666
Should I get
another gurney?

169
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,366
Yeah, a double‐wide
and a winch.

170
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,733
I hope the wheels
don't snap.

171
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,200
Trauma one,
I'll be right there.

172
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,500
Talk me to Doris,
what is this?

173
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,066
The second victim
is Fred Danziger.

174
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,533
‐ I'm fine, doc.
‐ Short of breath.

175
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:08,100
He singed his moustache
putting out the flames.

176
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,233
These paramedics overreact.

177
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:10,333
It's the first call this week

178
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:11,733
where something was on fire

179
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,500
and she drags me away
at the drop of a hat.

180
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,133
She could be right, okay?

181
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,266
Singed facial hair
could mean a burned airway.

182
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,233
Chuny, let's put
Fred on a pulse ox.

183
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,666
‐ And get a chest x‐ray.
‐ You bet.

184
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,166
I really had to force
him to come in here.

185
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,300
This new policy sucks.

186
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,666
Adding paramedics
to fire trucks?

187
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,366
Yeah and the
guys resent it.

188
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,066
You know, they're firefighters,
so, they blame me

189
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,333
for having to answer
so many medical calls.

190
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,733
Nobody likes change.
You did the right thing.

191
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:36,200
So, you passed out
and took a fall?

192
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,333
Angie...found me.

193
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:40,133
Is Angie your
home health aide?

194
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
She was.

195
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,066
They burn out
fast with me.

196
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,766
Did you see my chart?

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,633
Yes, sir,
pancreatic cancer

198
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,800
and mets to the liver.

199
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,266
I keep hoping that
end stage means it..

200
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,633
..can't get any worse.

201
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,733
The nausea pretty bad?

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,766
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay.

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,666
We're going to hydrate you,
see if that helps.

204
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,400
Would you like me to put
your own robe back on?

205
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,433
It can get pretty
chilly in here.

206
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,200
Did...did Angie
call my son?

207
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,633
I can find out.

208
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,500
Is that yours?

209
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,466
Ten years ago..

210
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,166
...I kicked my son out
of the house over this stuff.

211
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,033
Now, I depend on him
to get it for me.

212
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,133
Helps with the nausea?

213
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,233
Do you have
to take it?

214
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:31,633
Take what?

215
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,100
Ms. Meredith,
can you open your eyes?

216
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,633
She's been unresponsive
since the valium.

217
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,600
Pulse ox is 99 percent.

218
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:43,233
Can you imagine lugging
around all this fat?

219
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,800
Didn't stop her from hitting
the udon noodles at 9 A. M.

220
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,300
Does radiology
stock a extra

221
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,733
extra large?

222
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,400
Better call
the vet school.

223
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:53,533
Okay, everybody,
settle down.

224
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,733
Ms. Meredith, you've had
a bad allergic reaction.

225
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,700
So, you have a tube in your
mouth helping you to breathe.

226
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,400
‐ BP's 90/60.
‐ Yeah.

227
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:03,133
Let's start dopamine
at five mics per kilo.

228
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,033
‐ How many kilos?
‐ You want a calculator?

229
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:09,700
‐ What do you think, 275 pounds?
‐ Oh, I'll take the over.

230
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,666
‐ Hey, were you looking for me?
‐ Yeah, Carter.

231
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,733
Uh, Connie,
start her at 750 mics.

232
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,733
Let me know how she does.

233
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:18,766
You're gonna be fine.
We've got it under control.

234
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,333
I wanted to let you know
that as part of your workload

235
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,766
you're gonna teach
patient‐doctor class

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,166
to second‐year students.

237
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
‐ Patient‐doctor class?
‐ Yeah.

238
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,500
Students practice H and P's
on simulated patients.

239
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,266
No, I remember, you used
bad actors to come in

240
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,733
and pretend like
they're sick, I hated it.

241
00:09:32,766 --> 00:09:34,233
Yeah, well,
why is that?

242
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,700
I don't know,
'cause it's fake.

243
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,033
Everybody knows
it's fake.

244
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,233
The students know
it's fake.

245
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,400
‐ It's a waste of time.
‐ Yeah.

246
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,400
Well, starting tomorrow

247
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,500
you're gonna learn to
hate it all over again.

248
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,766
It'll sharpen your
teaching skills.

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Hey, did, uh..

250
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:48,166
...Lucy give me
a bad evaluation?

251
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,066
Lucy gave you a
fair evaluation.

252
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,300
I'll put the teaching
guide in your box.

253
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,733
Patient collapsed
push‐starting a car.

254
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,233
Slurred speech
and right‐side weakness

255
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,533
Resolved in 30 minutes.

256
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,200
‐ Suggesting?
‐ A TIA.

257
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,366
Dr. Corday ordered
a Doppler ultrasound

258
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,566
of his carotid arteries.

259
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,066
Which demonstrates what?

260
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,166
A 50 percent lesion
on the left side.

261
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,733
Is this
a surgical candidate?

262
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:10,466
Uh, he's pretty old.

263
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,033
How old? You said
he was push‐starting a car.

264
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,033
He claims not to know
his exact age.

265
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,066
Yeah, well, wasn't your
civil war in the 1860's?

266
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,566
According to Mr. Barnes,
he's roughly a 140.

267
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
Hey, Elizabeth,
did you get my message?

268
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,366
‐ Is now a good time?
‐ I'm not sure.

269
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,166
Yeah, go ahead, Ms. Knight
and I can handle this.

270
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,633
Peter, 8 o'clock
tonight, right?

271
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,700
I don't know
if I can make it.

272
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:29,766
Yeah, we need
to compile

273
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,766
our sternal saw data
by tomorrow.

274
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,233
Mr. Barnes, what are you
doing out of bed?

275
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,233
I asked you
to call me Charley.

276
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:40,200
Sir, you have to stay
in your gown

277
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,100
so Dr. Benton
can examine you.

278
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:44,233
‐ Is that you?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

279
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:50,166
I don't mean
no disrespect

280
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,700
but when you get
to be my age

281
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,600
and you loll around in bed,
them rheumatoids kick in

282
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,400
and pretty soon
you can't move at all.

283
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,700
Unfortunately, you
have blockage

284
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:01,133
in your neck artery.

285
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,633
It puts you at risk
for a stroke.

286
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,433
No, no, no,
I can't have that.

287
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,233
Too many people
counting on me.

288
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,233
Charley helps the older people
in his neighborhood.

289
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,433
'And the children.'

290
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,100
I mean 'cause they
need sitters.

291
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:13,566
Those people
working all day.

292
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,433
Are you, uh,
her teacher?

293
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,466
At the moment.

294
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,600
Then you know,
you and I

295
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,233
we have the responsibility

296
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:24,600
to pass on what life
has taught us.

297
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:28,700
Can you, uh,
fix me up?

298
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:30,733
Well, there is
a surgical option

299
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:34,266
but I'd hesitate
to use it on someone..

300
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,466
Well, someone your age.

301
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,400
Oh, you ain't ever seen
a patient my age.

302
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,066
You don't have to worry.

303
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,133
I can't be killed

304
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,700
'cause I got
a conjure on me.

305
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:46,766
I don't know
what that means.

306
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Of course, you don't.

307
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,133
'Cause you are
a man of science.

308
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,433
How else are you
going to explain

309
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,600
my being alive at all

310
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,100
when every other body

311
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,533
all the ones
from slavery times

312
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,433
done died..

313
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:04,000
...50 and 60
years ago?

314
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,633
Ms. Knight,
what would you suggest?

315
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,700
I'd call a
psych consult.

316
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,566
Is that the doc
for loonies?

317
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,400
Uh...yes, sir.

318
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,666
Yeah, yes, it is.

319
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,400
Uh‐huh.

320
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:29,166
He's outrageous.
He can be tasteless.

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,533
He certainly likes
to throw his weight around

322
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,200
but, uh..

323
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,200
So you can't corroborate
any instances

324
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,766
of‐of sexual harassment?

325
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,800
It's a very, um..

326
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,533
It's a very American thing,
if I may say.

327
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:45,266
This‐this penchant for turning
personal issues into lawsuits.

328
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:49,533
The hospital's hope,
of course, is for me

329
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:51,166
as omsbudsperson

330
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,366
to address problems
and avoid lawsuits.

331
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,433
No, one has to be thick‐skinned
working around Dr. Romano

332
00:12:56,466 --> 00:13:00,166
but, uh, you roll
with the punches, don't you?

333
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,233
Whoever is complaining
may be too fragile

334
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,400
to practice
medicine at all.

335
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:07,033
Her identity
is confidential

336
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,666
until I can assess
if any action is warranted.

337
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
It's a delicate business.

338
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,633
Rarely, do I hear
the kind of slam dunk

339
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:18,500
where Dr. So‐and‐so made
overt sexual advances.

340
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,366
'She declined and then
he either fired her'

341
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,200
'or cut her funds.'

342
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,400
Right.

343
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,566
‐ Uh, Kerry.
‐ 'Hmm?'

344
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,666
Is Robert aware
of this complaint?

345
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,733
He doesn't know who came to me

346
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:34,233
although, he could
figure it out

347
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,066
since my first response
is to prevent

348
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,600
the parties
from working together.

349
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,600
I see.

350
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,500
It's my fault,
I let it go on too long.

351
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,733
It's not your fault.
I'm going to start a line.

352
00:13:45,766 --> 00:13:48,433
‐ Joi, what's going on?
‐ Remember Ricky?

353
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,066
He hasn't had a bowel movement
in three days.

354
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,400
Joi got worried
when his temp

355
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,633
spiked to 101.

356
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,133
Oh, my god,
I let him get septic.

357
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,633
I've always been able
to disimpact him before.

358
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,400
‐ You disimpact him at home?
‐ Yeah.

359
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,300
I just usually use
a glove and Vaseline

360
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,700
but I couldn't do
it this time.

361
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:02,266
The morphine's
made him constipated.

362
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,533
Why is he on morphine?

363
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:05,600
He's having pain
from contractures.

364
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,233
That's what I think.

365
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,800
Ricky stopped speaking
about a week ago.

366
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,233
I'm sorry.

367
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,633
He still opens
his eyes sometimes.

368
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,400
And is the morphine
working for the pain?

369
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:17,633
I don't know.

370
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,133
Oh, God!

371
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,133
‐ It's alright, I got it.
‐ Oh, my..

372
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,366
I'm sorry.

373
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,300
It's just..

374
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,366
I..

375
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,266
I know, I know.

376
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,466
After everything
he's been through

377
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,533
I fall apart over this.

378
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,200
It's okay, it's okay.

379
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,366
I know.

380
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,166
When we got
to Michigan Avenue

381
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,566
he just passed out.

382
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
How long ago did
he hit his head?

383
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,133
Four hours,
He was fixing

384
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,066
a flood light
over our garage

385
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,333
and the ladder slipped,
but he seemed okay.

386
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,200
He just had a headache.

387
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,733
Whenever you have
a head injury

388
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:07,233
it's best to call
the paramedics.

389
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:08,333
I did call.

390
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,466
Paramedics
didn't show up?

391
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
'No, they came.'

392
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,400
but Jim seemed okay.

393
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:14,033
And then there
was a fire somewhere

394
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,033
and they got called away.

395
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,133
Jerry's gonna show you

396
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,700
where you can
park your car.

397
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:20,400
Jerry, I want you
to call dispatch.

398
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,133
Find out which unit responded
to the Haggertys' call.

399
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,633
Done.

400
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,200
Ricky's resting.

401
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,700
His fever is due
to an ear infection.

402
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,266
They're treating it
with antibiotics.

403
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,800
Oh, thank you, Carol,
for everything.

404
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,300
Oh, sure,
Dr. Ross will be

405
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,500
out here in a minute
to talk to you about it.

406
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,466
You always see me
when I'm such a wreck.

407
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,100
I usually cope
much better.

408
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,766
Well, sometimes coping
too much

409
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
can drive you crazy.

410
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,100
I meant to send you
a thank‐you note.

411
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,766
The respite care
has been wonderful.

412
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,533
Oh, good. Did you get
to your daughter's recital?

413
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:50,566
Hmm, and I had the worker
come back another time

414
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,433
just so I could
take a bath.

415
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,533
‐ Good for you.
‐ Yeah.

416
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,266
We had some
great news last week.

417
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,100
My daughter's
blood test came back.

418
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,166
‐ She's not a carrier.
‐ Oh, that's a relief.

419
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Oh, thank God, she'll never
do this to her kids.

420
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,166
Joi?

421
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,733
Uh, we're going
to keep him here

422
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,766
until his fever
comes down.

423
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,166
I'll see you
before you go, okay?

424
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,433
‐ Okay.
‐ Hm‐hmm.

425
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:14,566
Does this mean
we have to reduce

426
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,633
Ricky's morphine
to prevent

427
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,066
this happening
again or..

428
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
Well, that's one thing
we could do.

429
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,033
This was the hardest
part with Michael.

430
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,266
I lost Ricky's older brother
to ALD three years ago.

431
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,766
Right.

432
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,100
And now, he can't
tell me it hurts.

433
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:35,466
Somehow, it's worse
to see him suffering.

434
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,733
Let me check,
There may be something else

435
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:38,133
we can do for the pain.

436
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,266
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

437
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
I'm in.
Hyperventilate him.

438
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:48,166
BP 160/90, pulse 60,
Mannitol's in.

439
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,300
Mrs. Haggerty, your husband
has a blown pupil.

440
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,133
I'm worried the bleeding
in his skull

441
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,266
could be putting
pressure on his brain.

442
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,700
‐ Oh, no.
‐ 'CT's ready.'

443
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:58,333
We're gonna get a head CT
to find out what's going on.

444
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,300
Malik, take Mrs. Haggerty
to the chairs.

445
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,400
Chuny, call neurosurgery
down here right away.

446
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,433
Okay.

447
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:08,066
Elizabeth, I was afraid you
wouldn't be joining us.

448
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm looking
forward to it.

449
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:13,033
You don't see a
choledochojejunostomy every day.

450
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:15,033
When they shuffled
the surgical schedule yesterday

451
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,266
I was afraid,
I was going to miss out.

452
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,466
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

453
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,733
The resident
let the patient eat

454
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,533
and we had to postpone.

455
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,466
It's a problem sometimes
with residents rotating

456
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,233
in from other departments.

457
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:25,800
They're either not up to it
or they simply don't care.

458
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,633
‐ Who was this resident?
‐ Uh.

459
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,566
Third year from
the emergency department.

460
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,300
Uh, Doyle.

461
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:32,800
‐ Maggie Doyle?
‐ Hmm.

462
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,700
'They think very highly
of her down there.'

463
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,100
I believe she's being
considered for chief resident.

464
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,233
Pickings must be
pretty slim this year.

465
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,200
I've always found her
to be extremely capable.

466
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:45,200
Huh! I understand she makes
a lot of women uncomfortable.

467
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,166
Anyway, this is
going to be nifty.

468
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,766
Uh, the ultrasound
showed stones

469
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,233
in the common
bile duct distal

470
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:53,433
to the
sphincter of oddi.

471
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:55,333
No kidding.

472
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,533
I'm telling you, my whole team
is tied up in the OR.

473
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:00,233
I'm telling you that someone
needs to scrub out and join us.

474
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,433
Well, that's why
you have to wait.

475
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:02,766
Look at the size
of that blood clot.

476
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,400
It's compressing
his brain.

477
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,033
Every second counts.

478
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,366
Chuny,
shave the scalp.

479
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,266
Malik, open
the burr hole tray.

480
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,266
You can't do
burr holes in the ER.

481
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,400
Well, you're not giving
me any choice, are you?

482
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:17,333
Hey, what size gloves
do you take?

483
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,200
I am not comfortable with this.

484
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,500
We can't wait without risking
permanent brain damage.

485
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,533
Well, I'll try again
to get someone down.

486
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:24,700
Number 12 blade.

487
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,400
Pulse is down to 55.

488
00:18:26,433 --> 00:18:27,700
Self‐retaining retractor.

489
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,033
This is a big mistake.

490
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,033
Pressure's up to 180/95.

491
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,600
That's the cushing response.

492
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,800
He's gonna herniate

493
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,366
unless, we relieve
the pressure.

494
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,566
Periosteal elevator.

495
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,366
My chief can be down
in 20 minutes.

496
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,766
Too long.

497
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,533
Hudson brace
and perforator.

498
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,500
I can see
the skull fracture line.

499
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:50,666
ABG is back.

500
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,800
PH 7.51, PC02 is 25,
P02 is 350.

501
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,166
That's what we want.

502
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,033
Okay. I'm ready
for the burr hole.

503
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,433
Can't you wait a few minutes?

504
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,733
Keep the irrigation coming.

505
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,633
I need to see
what I'm doing.

506
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,100
Please?

507
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,133
Not too deep.

508
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,300
It's okay.

509
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,266
I'm through
the inner table.

510
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,533
Okay, there's
the clot.

511
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,300
I need a dural
suction catheter.

512
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,266
Pulse up to 170.
BP's 140/70.

513
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,533
'Pupils are equal.'

514
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:32,566
'That's more like it.'

515
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,700
Wet sterile gauze.

516
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:35,300
Let's get him
up to the OR.

517
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,266
I'll alert the team.

518
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,766
Tell them to
take their time.

519
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,433
Hey, Dr. Greene.

520
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,066
‐ Nice job.
‐ Alright.

521
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,700
Hey, Mark.

522
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,733
‐ Got time for a quick question?
‐ Yeah, sure.

523
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:53,266
How do I account
for a broken container

524
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,500
in the fracture study?

525
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,733
‐ One of the vials busted?
‐ Yeah.

526
00:19:55,766 --> 00:19:58,066
The powder...spilled
in the envelope.

527
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,533
Ah, I'd just make
a note of it.

528
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,066
It shouldn't
be a problem.

529
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,366
We haven't enlisted
as many patients

530
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,700
as anticipated.

531
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,333
We probably won't use
all the samples they sent.

532
00:20:05,366 --> 00:20:06,566
That's what
I wanted to know.

533
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,400
You going to make
your lecture?

534
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,466
Isn't the guy from NASA
going at the med school today?

535
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh, right.
I almost forgot.

536
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,666
Mrs. Haggerty, your husband
has been stabilized

537
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,333
and sent up to the OR.

538
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,400
What?

539
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,500
Jerry.

540
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,066
Uh, your husband
has been sent up

541
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,433
to the surgical floor,
so I'm going to find

542
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,533
somebody to take
you up there.

543
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,400
I'll take her up.

544
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,766
Dr. Greene stabilized
your husband.

545
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,366
He's doing fine.

546
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,733
Jerry, did you find out
which paramedic unit

547
00:20:30,766 --> 00:20:32,500
left Mr. Haggerty
with a brain bleed?

548
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,033
Yeah, dispatch said it
was an engine company

549
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,766
that went out
and Doris Pickman

550
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
was the paramedic
on board.

551
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,800
‐ Oh, boy.
‐ Yeah.

552
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,766
They said that the deputy chief
will take care of it from here.

553
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,300
Ah, I‐I don't want him
to handle it.

554
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,733
Listen, call dispatch back
and tell them

555
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,766
that I'm gonna follow up.

556
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
‐ Okay.
‐ Oh and Jerry.

557
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:47,800
If you put
that music back on

558
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,033
you're fired.

559
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I'm sorry it's
taking so long.

560
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:54,300
But since we put
my fingertip on ice

561
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,333
it'll be okay, right?

562
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,366
Like I told your dad

563
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
there's a possibility

564
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,633
we won't be able
to re‐attach.

565
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,333
‐ We'll let the surgeon decide.
‐ Hey.

566
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:02,666
Don't tell me you're still
waiting on plastics.

567
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,133
Yup, I called again.

568
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,566
They swore he's on his way.

569
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,066
Hey, did you find
another candidate

570
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
for that fracture study?

571
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:14,300
No, just recording
a broken container.

572
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:18,233
‐ Is he a plastic surgeon?
‐ No, I'm sorry.

573
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,733
You thirsty?
You want something to drink?

574
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,166
My dad's
getting me a coke.

575
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,666
Okay.

576
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,166
It shouldn't be
that much longer now.

577
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Did you find my son?

578
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:33,133
His office said he was
out on a sales call

579
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,766
and he's not picking
up his cell phone.

580
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,300
We'll keep trying.

581
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,533
Thank you.

582
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:40,800
Is the Zofran
helping the nausea?

583
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,300
No.

584
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,100
Okay, I'm gonna ask
the docs to add Reglan.

585
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:46,300
Don't bother.

586
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,700
They...they
don't work.

587
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:54,233
Any chance you could..

588
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,566
...wheel me outside
for some fresh air?

589
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,500
Mr. Ackerman..

590
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,500
...I can't take you outside
to smoke marijuana.

591
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,566
And maybe when your son arrives,
he can help you out.

592
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,500
‐ I'm really sorry.
‐ Don't..

593
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:09,766
Don't be.

594
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,133
I'm probably not able
to inhale anyway.

595
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,033
'The neuromuscular response
can be studied'

596
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:25,033
since there's no gravitational
force in the usual Z‐axis

597
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,766
from head to toe.

598
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,466
Gentleman in the back.

599
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,133
What are the applications
of this study?

600
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,033
The loss of muscle tone
in microgravity

601
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:36,566
is an issue that sci‐fi movies
have largely ignored.

602
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,733
Cosmonauts who spent months
on the Mir mission

603
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:42,200
had to be carried from
their spacecraft upon return.

604
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,633
'Now I'd like
to kick off the Q and A'

605
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,433
'with a question to you.'

606
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:47,766
What is it that interested you
in the astronaut program?

607
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,733
And I ask...because a lot of
candidates will admit

608
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:53,566
to childhood dreams
of adventure

609
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,500
the adrenaline of takeoff,
the vastness of space.

610
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,100
Sir, the doctor
who just walked in.

611
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,633
'Would you care to respond?'

612
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:04,433
Well, uh, for me, it was
pretty much, uh..

613
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,233
...adventure.

614
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:07,400
You know,
the adrenaline of takeoff

615
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,200
vastness of outer space.

616
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,433
Thank you
for your candor, doctor..

617
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:13,600
Mark Greene.

618
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,666
Ah, Dr. Greene.

619
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,533
Doug Lowrey wanted me
to look you up.

620
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:20,500
'Dr. Greene may be joining us
as a payload specialist.'

621
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,733
'But the real picture
of your schedule'

622
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,433
'should you make it
on a mission'

623
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:25,500
'is one of routine.'

624
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:26,700
'In training, you'll
spend an entire year'

625
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,300
'repeating the same
daily tasks'

626
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,566
'following checklists,
adapting to a regimen.'

627
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,266
'Everything you do is dictated
by the ground crew.'

628
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,700
'You follow a precise,
minute‐to‐minute itinerary.'

629
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,066
'There aren't even windows
in the mid‐deck..'

630
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,366
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Dr. Greene.

631
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,633
I didn't know
what else to do.

632
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,433
I‐I know I screwed up
really bad but the guy

633
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,066
seemed fine at the scene
and when the engine

634
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,633
got the fire call,
the guys were all so jazzed.

635
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,266
I told the wife
to bring the guy in‐‐

636
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,100
Doris, slow down.

637
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,700
Um, how's Mr. Haggerty?

638
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:54,733
He had an epidural hematoma,
but he should be okay.

639
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,500
The deputy chief
pulled me off active duty

640
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,266
and they're gonna start
a formal investigation.

641
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,366
‐ What?
‐ He's worried about bad press.

642
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,533
You know, "Fire engine leaves
an accident scene?"

643
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,666
Wait, that's a medical error.
I should make that call.

644
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,733
You know, maybe I was influenced
by the firefighters.

645
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:08,466
I knew that they really
wanted to get to that fire

646
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,266
and I know that that
shouldn't cloud my judgment.

647
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,700
But an investigation
is going to ruin my record.

648
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,433
Doris, take a breath.
I'll see what I can do.

649
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,333
‐ Will you?
‐ I'll call the deputy chief.

650
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
‐ Come on, doc.
‐ I'm not gonna do that.

651
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,800
No, you heard me.

652
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,266
Roll up your sleeves.
Come on.

653
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,366
I'm not gonna
arm wrestle with you

654
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,033
over whether you can
have surgery.

655
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,700
‐ Oh, you scared to?
‐ Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I am.

656
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,800
Well, I want the surgery.

657
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:31,533
That's all there is to it.

658
00:24:31,566 --> 00:24:33,733
And that one doctor
calculated that

659
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,166
I was fit
in the head.

660
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,600
Yeah, well, that's because you
didn't bother to mention

661
00:24:37,633 --> 00:24:39,466
to him you thought
you were at Appomattox.

662
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,100
But there was another
doctor who also said

663
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,166
my FEV 1

664
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,100
was over
120 percent.

665
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,733
Now, I think
that's darn good.

666
00:24:48,766 --> 00:24:50,666
They cleared you
physically for surgery.

667
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,266
No, see now you're giving me
that second‐rate pill idea.

668
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,466
I know you think the medical
treatment isn't that convincing

669
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,533
but I've got to use
my better judgment.

670
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,166
No, your judgment needs
to put your arm next to mine

671
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
clasping my hand

672
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:05,266
and we will a‐arm wrestle

673
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,333
because you'll
find out that old Charley

674
00:25:07,366 --> 00:25:09,600
is not as weak
and puny as you think.

675
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,133
I never said..

676
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,366
I don't think you're puny.

677
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
But you don't believe
I can't die.

678
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,566
Mm‐hmm.
Don't believe that one, either.

679
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,100
Thank you.

680
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,533
I'll give you something
you can believe.

681
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:20,333
Just...put your elbow
right here.

682
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,233
‐ Come on.
‐ Mr. Barnes, come on.

683
00:25:22,266 --> 00:25:26,100
Listen, if you don't give
a man his measure of respect

684
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,733
and you don't
believe his history

685
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,666
then you're talking
about a fight.

686
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:34,266
Oh, come on.
Don't make your elder beg.

687
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,033
Come on, huh?
Huh?

688
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:43,733
Yeah.

689
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:47,766
Go.

690
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,700
‐ Come on!
‐ Dr. Benton.

691
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:54,633
There is an OR available.

692
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,066
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't humor me now.

693
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,133
Oh, boy!

694
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,300
You win.

695
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,366
Nah.

696
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,233
You win.
Alright, go ahead.

697
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:14,500
‐ 'Book the OR.'
‐ 'Yeah.'

698
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:24,269
It's a brand‐new policy, putting
paramedics on fire trucks.

699
00:26:24,302 --> 00:26:26,702
It's gonna take a little
while to work the kinks out.

700
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:29,235
But I know Doris Pickman,
I work with her day to day

701
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:32,935
and she deserves to be
counseled, not put on a desk.

702
00:26:32,969 --> 00:26:35,769
No, no, no,
this is my job, and..

703
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,969
‐ Is Doug Ross around?
‐ Uh, try admit.

704
00:26:39,002 --> 00:26:41,869
Deputy Chief Mead, please.
It's Mark Greene again.

705
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,035
Doug.

706
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,102
Hey, Heather, they let you
out of the lab, huh?

707
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:49,435
Oh, I make special deliveries
for some customers.

708
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,902
We got the toxicology results
on that powder you brought us.

709
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:53,835
‐ Yeah, great.
‐ It's negative for codeine.

710
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,235
Mm‐hmm.

711
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:58,102
‐ Is that all you needed?
‐ That'll do it.

712
00:26:58,135 --> 00:26:59,735
When I heard you
hand‐carried it, I thought

713
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:03,935
well...maybe you were...
back in the market.

714
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,769
Me?
Uh, no, I‐‐

715
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,935
Doug, uh, I called
the handi‐van for the Abbotts

716
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:09,735
and Joi said you were
getting her a prescription.

717
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:10,969
Okay.
I'm on my way.

718
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:12,802
‐ Nice to see you.
‐ See you later.

719
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,169
Ricky's temp is 98.8...
which is good.

720
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,169
Now, you know, back there,
that was nothing, right?

721
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,902
Huh?
Yeah.

722
00:27:20,935 --> 00:27:22,402
Hey, Kerry, uh..

723
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,269
...I'm afraid Lynette has
appropriated the lounge.

724
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:25,902
Yeah, I guess the staff
will have to gossip

725
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,402
someplace else for
an hour, huh?

726
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:28,902
‐ You knew about it?
‐ Yeah.

727
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,435
She showed me
her proposal last week.

728
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:35,269
I think it's a good area
for the clinic to get into.

729
00:27:35,302 --> 00:27:37,102
'I know you can tell
if he's cheating, but‐‐'

730
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:38,702
'Alright, hold on,
your man don't take'

731
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,135
'a shower before he leaves
the house'

732
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,102
but he does take one
when he gets home?

733
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,835
‐ He's cheating.
‐ Cheating on her.

734
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,202
Tara's right.

735
00:27:45,235 --> 00:27:47,335
The number of partners
you have and he has

736
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:49,902
can definitely put you at risk
for cervical cancer.

737
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:52,869
Put you at risk
for being a damn fool, too.

738
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:54,969
'The other risk factor
is how young you were'

739
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:56,969
when you started having sex
and if you smoke.

740
00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:01,235
That's right.
Uh, this is Carol Hathaway.

741
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,902
She runs the clinic here.

742
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:04,869
Nice to meet you all.

743
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:06,702
'Oh, carry on.'

744
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:08,802
I think it's a really important
topic to be informed about

745
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:10,802
and, um...please feel free

746
00:28:10,835 --> 00:28:13,002
to come and see us
at the clinic anytime.

747
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,035
Thanks, Carol.

748
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,869
My apologies for the delay.
I'm Dr. Baker.

749
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:21,002
Hi. Jeanie Boulet.
This is Donna.

750
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:22,402
Her father should
be back soon.

751
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,702
‐ This is the x‐ray, Ms. Boulet?
‐ Yes.

752
00:28:25,735 --> 00:28:27,835
I did a digital nerve block
with Marcaine.

753
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:30,935
Mm‐hmm, amputation is midway
through the distal phalanx.

754
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,435
We'll need to rongeur
and do a V‐Y flap.

755
00:28:33,469 --> 00:28:35,102
You can put
it back on, right?

756
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:36,869
No. Not with a cut
at this level.

757
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,102
The blood vessels
are too small.

758
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:39,402
Did you explain to her?

759
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,169
I told her
it may be a possibility.

760
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:42,002
Mm‐hmm.

761
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:48,302
But you guys put
arms and stuff back on.

762
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:49,835
'That's true.'

763
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:51,169
If you'd cut your
finger at the base

764
00:28:51,202 --> 00:28:53,002
we'd have bigger arteries
to work with.

765
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,469
'For this, we'll...
trim down the bone'

766
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:58,035
and create a flap
over the defect.

767
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,469
You mean, I'll have a stump?

768
00:29:00,703 --> 00:29:02,436
Maybe we should talk
to Donna's father.

769
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,436
Yes, if we can get
a trauma room

770
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,003
I'll do the procedure
right away.

771
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:14,303
Don't worry, Donna. We'll make
you a small prosthetic tip.

772
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,370
I'm just saying, man,
oldies are played out.

773
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,570
People like the classics
mixed in.

774
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,436
Not ones you
can't dance to.

775
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,936
Yeah, I think you're
gonna lose 'em.

776
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,470
Jerry, what is this?

777
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:24,336
What, you said you wanted
the rap turned off, right?

778
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,203
No, actually, I said
we need a desk clerk here.

779
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:28,536
‐ Not a DJ.
‐ Fine. It's gone.

780
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,370
It's no more.
Forever gone.

781
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:33,503
You know, what possessed you
to pick that particular song?

782
00:29:33,536 --> 00:29:35,136
I don't know.
Just instinct, you know?

783
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,436
‐ I'm just going with the flow.
‐ Uh‐huh.

784
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,403
My mom used to play this album
all the time when I was a kid.

785
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:41,903
'It was always, like..'

786
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,303
'...the ultimate freedom.'

787
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:45,503
You know, leave ground
control behind

788
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:46,536
and just float away.

789
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,203
‐ Escape?
‐ Yeah.

790
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,436
Hey, the folks
in the waiting area

791
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,536
wanna know if you could
put Bowie back on?

792
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,136
Jerry, do whatever
you want, okay?

793
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,236
Just use your
best judgment.

794
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,536
Alright, now,
you give this to him

795
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,203
every six hours, if needed.

796
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:04,236
You don't exceed
four doses in 24 hours.

797
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,170
And you call me if it
isn't working for him.

798
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,470
Watch your head.

799
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:11,370
Why didn't the genetics clinic
suggest this medication?

800
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:13,470
Well, it's brand‐new. It's still
part of a clinical trial.

801
00:30:13,503 --> 00:30:15,970
We've had a lot of luck
with kids with fractures.

802
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,003
Perfectly safe for Ricky.

803
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:18,936
It might give
him some relief.

804
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,503
Do I need to fill on
any of this out?

805
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,370
Um, I wouldn't bother.

806
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,536
He's not a candidate
for the study.

807
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,103
Here you go. Okay?

808
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:26,936
‐ Thank you.
‐ Yup!

809
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,370
Trauma two is open.
Are you free to assist me?

810
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:37,103
I insist on it.

811
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,436
You blew by that
twelve‐year‐old girl

812
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,570
like she was a minor annoyance
in your busy day.

813
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,536
You said...there's a parent
here to give consent.

814
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,436
‐ Yes.
‐ Find him, please.

815
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,670
I'll explain
the procedure.

816
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:49,036
I'll do that.

817
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,303
I can't believe I get
to scrub in on my first day.

818
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:56,636
‐ That's the best way to learn.
‐ Ready for masks?

819
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,670
Charley attracted quite
a crowd in the waiting room.

820
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:00,436
Does anyone know
where he's from?

821
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,536
They say that he's lived
in the neighborhood for years.

822
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,170
That car
he was push‐starting?

823
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:07,136
Registration expired
in 1956.

824
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,636
He had all these
terrible stories‐‐

825
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,070
What are the first two branches
of the internal carotid?

826
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:14,236
The ophthalmic artery and
the posterior communicating.

827
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,603
Yeah. Okay. That's it.
You're ready.

828
00:31:16,636 --> 00:31:17,936
Let's go.

829
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:26,636
Gown and glove, Ms. Knight.
She doesn't know the ropes.

830
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,203
How are we doing,
Dr. Riggs?

831
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:29,636
‐ Just about to put him under.
‐ 'Alright.'

832
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,170
'Around the table.'

833
00:31:31,203 --> 00:31:32,503
Keep your hands in front
of you above your waist.

834
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,036
Don't reach for anything
unless you're told.

835
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,070
What if I have an itch?

836
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,103
Tell a nurse
where to scratch.

837
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,370
What is that?

838
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:40,070
‐ Dr. Riggs?
‐ He's bradying down.

839
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:42,536
‐ Alright. Atropine!
‐ One milligram onboard.

840
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,936
His blood pressure's dropping.

841
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,136
Damn!
He's in v‐fib.

842
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,436
Lucy, grab the crash cart, now.
Move!

843
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,936
‐ I'm sterile.
‐ It doesn't make a difference.

844
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,570
Charge to 200.
Amp of epi.

845
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:50,670
Let's move.
Come on.

846
00:31:50,703 --> 00:31:53,036
Clear!

847
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,070
‐ Asystole.
‐ Start compressions.

848
00:31:55,103 --> 00:31:56,636
Epi and atropine onboard.

849
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,136
Right.
What's the rhythm?

850
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,336
Got an idioventricular rhythm.

851
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,936
Alright.
He's gotta faint pulse.

852
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,003
Lucy, try to get a BP.

853
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,203
Can he still have surgery?

854
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:05,303
No. Let's get him a room
in the ICU.

855
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,436
Hey.

856
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,170
How long till spring?

857
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,036
I think this is the shortest
day of the year, isn't it?

858
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,670
Uh, no, that's December.
We're way past that.

859
00:32:21,703 --> 00:32:24,503
Made up my mind.
Not going to Houston.

860
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,136
Really?

861
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,603
‐ It's an old dream.
‐ You could've fooled me.

862
00:32:30,636 --> 00:32:33,003
I thought you were
ready to blast off.

863
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:36,370
I realized...
I didn't want to go.

864
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:39,503
I don't want
to go anywhere.

865
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,503
This is what I do.
This is where I belong.

866
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:44,570
Yeah.

867
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,970
Lost that old
restlessness, huh?

868
00:32:47,003 --> 00:32:49,370
‐ I guess, yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

869
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:56,470
‐ Coming in?
‐ Yeah.

870
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,570
‐ Come on in.
‐ It's cold.

871
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:02,603
What upsets me is that you
went out of your way

872
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:03,636
not to involve me.

873
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:04,670
Why would I do that?

874
00:33:04,703 --> 00:33:05,970
Maybe you knew
I would object.

875
00:33:06,003 --> 00:33:07,270
Object to what?

876
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:08,536
Well, I noticed
that all the women

877
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,536
who attended
were African American.

878
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,636
Yeah, that's right.

879
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,236
The clinic's for
everyone, Lynette.

880
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,570
Well, I didn't
exclude anyone.

881
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:15,970
Where did you advertise?

882
00:33:16,003 --> 00:33:17,436
But I do have
a special interest

883
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,036
in an underserved
population

884
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,970
that is, uh,
particularly at risk.

885
00:33:21,003 --> 00:33:23,570
Uh, Latinas are even more at
risk than African Americans.

886
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:25,003
Our death rate is higher.

887
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,370
Vietnamese women
have even more statistics.

888
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,403
Carol, to get women
to consider

889
00:33:29,436 --> 00:33:30,636
changing their
sexual habits

890
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,370
they need
to feel open.

891
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:34,936
Women talk more freely
among their own.

892
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,636
Well, then, we're gonna have
to hold more seminars

893
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,903
that target
other populations.

894
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:42,403
Look, I did this on my own time
out of my own interest.

895
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:44,036
I understand that.

896
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:46,403
But I can't have you
pulling against me.

897
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:48,136
If you want to continue
working in the clinic

898
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,570
you need to adjust
your project

899
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:51,003
to include other people.

900
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:54,236
Well..

901
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,303
I guess you've given me
something to think about.

902
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:03,470
Couple more stitches
and the Y is closed, see?

903
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:05,036
Mm‐hmm.

904
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,570
What kind of music
do you play, Donna?

905
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:11,303
Um...
folk and classical.

906
00:34:11,336 --> 00:34:13,003
Some rock.

907
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:14,103
Well, Ms. Boulet
is right.

908
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,103
More 5‐0 nylon,
please.

909
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:19,003
The prosthetic will take
some getting used to

910
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:22,436
but with time, you'll be
able to play just fine.

911
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,136
What about computer games?

912
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:27,170
No, those you'll never
be able to touch again.

913
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,303
Your dad paid me
to say that.

914
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:31,136
Oh!

915
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,536
Cut, please, Jenny.

916
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,603
It's Jeanie.

917
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,236
Sorry, Ms. Boulet.

918
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:41,170
Honest, I owe you
my firstborn.

919
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:42,503
You do that and
you're on a desk.

920
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:44,270
No, really.
You saved my career.

921
00:34:44,303 --> 00:34:47,036
I gave you a chance
to turn it around.

922
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,303
We'll work out a counseling
schedule next week, okay?

923
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:50,936
‐ Get back out there.
‐ Alright. Thanks.

924
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,470
‐ Where's Jerry?
‐ In between sets.

925
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:55,270
Actually, I was
taking requests.

926
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,103
‐ Hey, you off?
‐ Yeah. Why?

927
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,470
Oh, that poor guy in exam two,
he wanted to say bye to you.

928
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:01,370
Oh, Mr. Ackerman?
Pancreatic cancer?

929
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:02,636
Yeah, he's gonna have
to stay the night.

930
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,670
Nobody picks him up
until tomorrow.

931
00:35:03,703 --> 00:35:05,070
Thanks.

932
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,270
Ms. Abbott,
well, are you still

933
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:07,503
waiting for
the health bus?

934
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:09,070
No, he's here.
We're all loaded up.

935
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:11,103
I just had another
question for Dr. Ross.

936
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:13,936
Dr. Ross is...
in a meeting.

937
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,336
Is there something
I can help you with?

938
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,436
Oh, he gave some
new medication to us.

939
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,070
And...I forgot to ask

940
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:21,503
if it's alright
to take it with Robaxin.

941
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,536
‐ My son has ALD.
‐ And he has a fracture?

942
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,136
No, but he was in pain

943
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,536
and Dr. Ross thought
this might help.

944
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,470
Well, where's
your study envelope?

945
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,970
He said we didn't need
to bother with that.

946
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,636
Dr. Ross did.

947
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,403
Since my son isn't actually
a candidate for the trial.

948
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,003
I see.

949
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,236
I heard your son
couldn't make it.

950
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:00,070
Okay.

951
00:36:05,936 --> 00:36:06,970
You need this?

952
00:36:07,003 --> 00:36:08,870
Please.

953
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:44,603
Never mind.

954
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,503
Oh, God!

955
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,236
Again?

956
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,870
Okay. Okay.

957
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,970
Hey, is Doug
still upstairs?

958
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:44,270
I don't know.

959
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,236
Well, I'm headed home.

960
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:49,370
Mark, what are you doing?

961
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,603
Do you know anything
about a boy with ALD?

962
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:53,103
Ricky Abbott?

963
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:55,970
Why was he given meds
for the clinical trial?

964
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:57,170
He wasn't.
Doug wouldn't do that.

965
00:37:58,436 --> 00:37:59,436
Looks like he did.

966
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:02,403
Mark.

967
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:03,503
Talk to Doug.

968
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,170
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

969
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,603
Yeah.

970
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:16,036
Ms. Boulet...
I wanted to thank you

971
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,403
for assisting
on the finger flap.

972
00:38:17,436 --> 00:38:18,570
Not at all.

973
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:20,636
And for reminding me
to take time

974
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,536
with our young patient.

975
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,470
I don't do well
when I get behind schedule.

976
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,970
But that's no excuse.

977
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,436
You were right
and I thank you.

978
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,903
You're welcome.

979
00:38:29,936 --> 00:38:31,503
Yeah, I was wondering
if by any chance

980
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,136
you'd be free
to join me for an opening

981
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,436
at the Art Institute
this evening.

982
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,570
This evening?

983
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,470
I realize
it's short notice.

984
00:38:37,503 --> 00:38:39,170
But it may
be interesting.

985
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,236
Raghubir Singh,
an Indian photographer.

986
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,903
I'm afraid I don't know
that much about art.

987
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,303
I'm afraid I don't
care much about art

988
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:47,670
but I promised my wife,
who had died a few years ago

989
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,203
that I'd keep up
our membership

990
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:51,603
and...not become a total
Philistine without her.

991
00:38:51,636 --> 00:38:53,403
I'm sorry to hear
that you lost your wife.

992
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:55,370
Mm‐hmm.
And my partner.

993
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:58,036
Jenny and I had a practice
together for 15 years.

994
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,536
‐ Her name was Jenny?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

995
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,370
You're a sweet angel.

996
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:03,103
‐ Called for a consult?
‐ Yeah!

997
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:06,036
‐ Self‐inflicted knife wounds.
‐ Quite a few of them.

998
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,270
Mr. Michaels gave me
a little suturing refresher.

999
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:09,636
She's my angel.

1000
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,303
That is not what
he was calling me

1001
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:12,903
before the Haldol.

1002
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,670
Belly seems benign,
no blood in urine.

1003
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:16,570
But these two need a
two‐layer closures.

1004
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:19,036
Good bowel sounds.
Belly's soft.

1005
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,436
I‐I wanted to mention to you

1006
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,470
I've been having
a problem with...Dr. Romano.

1007
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:28,036
Uh...yeah, Kerry spoke
with me this morning..

1008
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,970
...without actually
saying it was you.

1009
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:32,470
I'm sorry I didn't ask before
dragging your name into it.

1010
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,070
Well...I don't think
I can be of any help.

1011
00:39:39,403 --> 00:39:42,303
Well, there's no sign
of any intra‐abdominal bleed.

1012
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,503
He's got another
one on his back.

1013
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:45,336
We'll have to lift him.

1014
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,603
You know...I was hoping
that Romano would cool it

1015
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,670
if I confronted him,
but instead, he threatened

1016
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:51,236
to blast me
on my evaluation‐‐

1017
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,636
‐ You got him?
‐ Yeah.

1018
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,370
Dr. Romano
can be volatile.

1019
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:57,136
Yeah, you mean he's a‐a..

1020
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,036
...mean‐spirited,
little power monger?

1021
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,170
That, too.

1022
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,436
Well, the kidneys
look fine, as well.

1023
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,170
Whores! Whores! Whores!
I want to die!

1024
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,536
Oh, oh, there's
the Mr. Michaels

1025
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,570
I know and love.

1026
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,236
Look, um...Romano.

1027
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,203
He likes to push
things to the limit.

1028
00:40:15,236 --> 00:40:18,403
Guess he thought anything
goes with the gay chick.

1029
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:21,003
Well, I just hope you're not,
um...going out on a limb.

1030
00:40:23,036 --> 00:40:25,036
He's a star.

1031
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,536
Self‐respect's a bitch.

1032
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,503
Uh, Kerry! Kerry,
do you have a moment?

1033
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:33,236
Yeah, Mark needed
to talk to me.

1034
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,570
You're on your way out?

1035
00:40:34,603 --> 00:40:36,236
How about I buy you
breakfast tomorrow?

1036
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,670
I think that sounds
like more that a minute.

1037
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,103
Well, I've been thinking
about your inquiry

1038
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,303
and I may have
some things to add.

1039
00:40:40,336 --> 00:40:41,536
Okay, I'll call you.

1040
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,203
‐ We'll set something up.
‐ Great!

1041
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:45,103
There she is,
Minnesota Fats.

1042
00:40:45,136 --> 00:40:46,236
I was afraid I missed you.

1043
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,436
‐ Hey, Reggie.
‐ Hey.

1044
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,570
So you're gonna
give me a chance

1045
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:50,303
to win my money
back tonight, right?

1046
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:53,270
Well, I can't play pool two
nights in a row. It's bad luck.

1047
00:40:53,303 --> 00:40:55,203
It's bad luck to play
one night against you.

1048
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:56,470
Where did you learn
to clear a table like that?

1049
00:40:56,503 --> 00:40:58,636
Signs of a misspent youth.

1050
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,670
So what do you say
we get a bite to eat today?

1051
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:03,136
Actually, I already
have plans for tonight.

1052
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,070
Something a new friend
can barge in on?

1053
00:41:05,103 --> 00:41:07,103
Opening at
the Art Institute.

1054
00:41:07,136 --> 00:41:08,303
Uh, say no more.

1055
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:09,336
I'll catch you
on the weekend.

1056
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,336
Okay.

1057
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,403
I am so pissed.

1058
00:41:14,436 --> 00:41:15,603
I almost went
straight to Anspaugh.

1059
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:17,303
What the hell
was Doug thinking?

1060
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,903
Well, it certainly
wasn't about county.

1061
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,070
If we were exposed
for breaking protocol

1062
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,503
on a federally
funded trial‐‐

1063
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:24,070
They'd cut off research money

1064
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:26,070
and medicare payments for years.

1065
00:41:26,103 --> 00:41:29,336
Not to mention
that it's against the law.

1066
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,003
They brought me the study.

1067
00:41:32,036 --> 00:41:33,436
I got him on board.

1068
00:41:35,236 --> 00:41:36,670
Mark, given the implications

1069
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,936
I‐I don't think
we have any choice

1070
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,470
but to handle
this internally.

1071
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,470
‐ Cover it up?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

1072
00:41:44,036 --> 00:41:46,436
Anspaugh finds out,
he has to react.

1073
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,670
Nice position
he put us in, huh?

1074
00:41:51,703 --> 00:41:55,270
Mark, do you have the key
to the pain study cabinet?

1075
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:57,070
Doug, why don't you
come in and take a seat?

1076
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,070
Mm‐hmm.

1077
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:07,336
Any changes?

1078
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:11,303
Will he wake up?

1079
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:14,203
What do you think?

1080
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:16,670
His brain was deprived
of a lot of oxygen

1081
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,303
during the cardiac arrest.

1082
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,003
Mm‐hmm...and old folks
don't usually come back

1083
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:24,336
with full function
after hypoxic insult.

1084
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,503
It's a wait‐and‐see.

1085
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:30,103
He could live like this
for a while.

1086
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:33,070
Forever.
Well, according to him.

1087
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,236
What's his Glasgow score?

1088
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,170
An eight.

1089
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:45,403
No spontaneous
eye‐opening.

1090
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:47,936
No speaking.

1091
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:50,636
Responds only
to painful stimulus.

1092
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,203
Excuse me.

1093
00:43:02,603 --> 00:43:05,036
I'm sorry, I just
didn't expect this.

1094
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:09,070
Yeah, well.
Neither did I.

1095
00:43:09,103 --> 00:43:11,470
Should I go tell
his neighbors?

1096
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:13,403
No.
I'll do it.

1097
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:19,136
'And then to top it off,
he goes to..'

1098
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,470
...Kerry Weaver instead of
coming, uh, to me.

1099
00:43:22,503 --> 00:43:24,103
But you gave Joi the meds?

1100
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,303
Well, yeah,
Mark said himself

1101
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:27,370
that he wasn't gonna
use all the samples.

1102
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:28,536
That's not the point,
though, is it?

1103
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:30,303
Well, what is the point?

1104
00:43:30,336 --> 00:43:31,936
That breaking
research protocol

1105
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,003
could damage
the hospital's funding.

1106
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:35,636
Mm‐hmm.

1107
00:43:38,303 --> 00:43:40,170
So you, uh,
you agree with him?

1108
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,236
No.
I‐I see their point.

1109
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,370
You know how sick
that kid is?

1110
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:47,070
Yeah.

1111
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:50,536
But that decision could
have a much larger impact.

1112
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,336
Alright, the hospital
is only at risk

1113
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,070
if someone goes
out of their way

1114
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:55,536
to report me and believe me

1115
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,170
it kills Kerry Weaver
not to be able to do that.

1116
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,403
I don't know
what to say, Doug.

1117
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,870
Yeah.

1118
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,436
Doug, don't walk away.

1119
00:44:23,603 --> 00:44:25,336
Doug!
