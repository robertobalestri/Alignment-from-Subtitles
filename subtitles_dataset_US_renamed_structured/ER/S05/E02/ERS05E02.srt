1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,033
Previously on "ER.."

2
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:08,700
Well, Ms. Knight,
welcome to County General.

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:10,100
You do know how
to do this, right?

4
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,166
Yes.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,400
You've broken
every rule

6
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:14,200
and regulation
we have in the ER.

7
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,333
It seems in the best
interest of the child

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:17,566
to complete
what's been started.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,166
I wanted to ask you,
Dr. Anspaugh

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
about the possibility
of sponsorship for next year.

11
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,266
You don't want to
continue with Dr. Romano?

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,366
Dr. Romano doesn't wish
to continue with me.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,533
Haven't gotten much sleep
since I took that RA Job.

14
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,200
Had to take the day off
so I could run the clinic.

15
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,100
I don't suppose you could
spare anyone to help me out?

16
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:33,066
There's a position's opening
District Medical Director

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,533
for EMS. We could use
someone like you on our side.

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,166
‐ 'Dr. Carter?'
‐ 'Dr. Carter, are you there?'

19
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,366
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'
‐ 'I'm so sorry, but we‐‐'

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,100
‐ 'Hey, we're locked out.'
‐ Uh, hang on.

21
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,633
Hang on. I'm coming.

22
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,800
Yes?

23
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,200
‐ What's up?
‐ Dr. Carter, I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,133
I know it's really late,
uh, really early‐‐

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,600
We're locked out.

26
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,233
We were in the library
and we left our bag‐packs

27
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:11,200
but I thought he had his key
and he thought I had mine.

28
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,400
No, I did have a key, okay?

29
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,266
But it wasn't
my dorm key.

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,433
'I had my old
apartment key'

31
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:17,600
but my sister
threw me out.

32
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,400
Okay, I got a master key.

33
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:23,033
‐ Sorry to wake you.
‐ It's my job.

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,400
‐ Oh, Peter.
‐ Hey, hi.

35
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:38,200
‐ I hope I'm not disturbing you.
‐ Mmm...no, no.

36
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:40,433
I‐I didn't expect you
to finish so soon.

37
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,300
Well, I, uh..

38
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,033
‐ It was just a spleen.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

39
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,566
‐ And I was thinking about you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,733
So I thought I would come over..

41
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:51,233
Mm‐hmm.

42
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:54,733
Come over...and finish
what we started.

43
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:59,133
Mm‐hmm. Peter?
Peter, I, uh, I..

44
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,133
What?

45
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:05,100
Before you jump
to any conclusions..

46
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,100
‐ You're not alone.
‐ Right. I'm‐‐

47
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,800
'Sorry to wake you
so early, darling.'

48
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,200
This jet lag..

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,700
'Oh, excuse me.'

50
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,100
I didn't realize
anyone had arrived.

51
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:19,633
Allow me, uh...this
is Peter Benton

52
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,666
'a, uh...work colleague..'

53
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:23,600
Obviously, a friend.

54
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,400
Uh, Peter, this is..

55
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,166
...Charles Corday, my father.

56
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:36,033
Oh. Um...nice to meet you.

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,633
‐ The toilet's overflowing.
‐ What?

58
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
'In the women's
bathroom?'

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,366
It's going
all over the floor.

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,166
That sounds like
a call for maintenance.

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,566
I'm just the RA.

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,233
Well, they're not on
until 7:00.

63
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:57,266
You better come.
It's getting bad.

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,200
'I'm calling to confirm
an 8:00 a. m. appointment.'

65
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:01,500
Carol Hathaway.

66
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,633
AC Working?

67
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,033
‐ I'm on with them now.
‐ Thank you.

68
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,566
Hey, you'll
knock 'em dead.

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,566
‐ Uh‐oh. What'd she do wrong?
‐ Me?

70
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
You see a med student
in two hours early

71
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,633
she must have
screwed something up.

72
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,033
No, she's checking her labs

73
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:15,100
that were pending yesterday.

74
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,133
Yeah. Just for fun.

75
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,166
I want to make sure nothing

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
slipped through the cracks.

77
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,600
No, don't burn out.

78
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,200
She's already
the resident's pet.

79
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,300
I am not.

80
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,766
She got an IV
solo her first day.

81
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,333
‐ So I was lucky.
‐ Morning, all.

82
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,800
Good morning.

83
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,333
Can somebody take a look
at my grandson? He's not right.

84
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,033
Sure if you just take a seat.
Someone will be right with you.

85
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,266
It's okay, I can take
a look at him.

86
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,400
‐ Lucy, you wanna join me?
‐ Sure.

87
00:03:33,433 --> 00:03:35,233
A month ago,
he was starting to walk.

88
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:36,600
Now he just lays there.

89
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,466
I'll join you as soon
as I stow my stuff.

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,633
There's no need.

91
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,800
Take them to exam four.

92
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, if you
need me to sign off

93
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,466
on any procedures‐‐

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,133
No, check your
calendar, Kerry.

95
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,800
My probation
was for 30 days.

96
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,533
‐ I'm a free man again.
‐ Thirty working days, Doug.

97
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,300
‐ I don't think so.
‐ I'll check on that.

98
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,233
I'm sure you will.
I got him.

99
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,466
Good luck upstairs.
Come on.

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
John Carter.

101
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,566
Dad, hi.
How's the sailing?

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Uh‐huh.

103
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:23,700
Uh‐huh. I think...I think
Gamma's being dramatic.

104
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,633
Because it's not a slum.

105
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,566
It's a...a dorm.

106
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,466
Well, dad, it pays the rent.

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,600
I said it pays the rent.

108
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,433
No, I'm not turning my back.

109
00:04:40,533 --> 00:04:43,233
Because I'm still a doctor.

110
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,766
It's just not clear,
it's just not clear

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
whether they're going to be
able to pay me or not this year.

112
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,466
The RA position
is for residents.

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,433
What the, no,
there's‐there's, um..

114
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,066
...student advising
and‐and counseling.

115
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,233
It's, you know...practically
a faculty position.

116
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,666
And it feels good
to pay my own way.

117
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,166
Dad?

118
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,033
Dad?

119
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,566
Hello? Hello?

120
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,633
Oh! Yosh, I'm so sorry.

121
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,233
I'm so excited.
They said yes.

122
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:11,466
‐ They said yes?
‐ They said yes!

123
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,033
‐ You're hot stuff!
‐ Thanks.

124
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:17,166
Mark, thank you so much.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
‐ They said yes.
‐ To your proposal?

126
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:20,366
Thanks to Mark's
great letter of support.

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,733
Ah, I just told the truth.

128
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:24,500
I said your clinic
deserved a salaried RN.

129
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,033
Oh. There you go, baby.

130
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,400
Eh, why‐why's
the number flashing?

131
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,666
'They're calling
on the land line.'

132
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,233
Mark's learning
the new radio.

133
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,733
Does this mean, you're
going to take the EMS job?

134
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,166
Well, I‐I haven't
decided yet.

135
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,066
Just touch the screen.

136
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,533
‐ On the number?
‐ It won't bite.

137
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,566
What'd‐what'd I do?

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
Well, when you touch it twice

139
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,766
you hang up on them.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,366
Don't worry.
They'll call back.

141
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,633
Jerry, what is going on
with the AC in here?

142
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,300
They were just here. Takes a
couple minutes for to cool down.

143
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,133
Oh, they're on med nine.

144
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,033
I gotta take this
up to the lab.

145
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:54,566
I'll take over.

146
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,133
Okay. Go ahead.
Just once.

147
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,166
Check volume.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,466
'Pulse 120. Gave 500 cc's
of normal saline. Copy?'

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,700
Uh, County General
on med nine.

150
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:07,600
We didn't catch
the first part.

151
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:08,633
Can you repeat?

152
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,033
You have to step
on the pedal

153
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,433
when you speak,
Dr. Greene.

154
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,033
County General
on med ni‐‐

155
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,233
Mark, you're not switched over.

156
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,633
You gotta switch over
to med nine first.

157
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,400
‐ Now.
‐ County General on med nine.

158
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,166
Can you please repeat
the information‐‐

159
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
I said "pulling up now."

160
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:25,300
Single vehicle MVA

161
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,466
'62‐year‐old
restrained driver.'

162
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,800
What's with the radio?

163
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,166
Well, Mark Greene is
considering a future in EMS.

164
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,566
We were just teaching
him the ropes.

165
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Uh‐huh. BP's 100 over 60,
tachy at 120, diaphoretic.

166
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,266
Airbags deployed. Wife was
a passenger in the front seat.

167
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,466
He just groaned
and slumped over the wheel.

168
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,300
Thank goodness we
were barely moving.

169
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,633
I didn't know
you were on today.

170
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,533
Uh, I'm not I'm just here to
talk to paramedics.

171
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:47,566
‐ When you're done.
‐ Yeah.

172
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
We're gonna take very good

173
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,166
care of your husband.

174
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,600
So, if I can't
persuade my daughter

175
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,466
you'd be interested
in the job?

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,533
Oh, you know. I have considered
a cardiothoracic fellowship.

177
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,666
I mean, as a specialty,
it has it all.

178
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,566
The heart, the most magnificent
machine in creation.

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,266
'I'm flattered you
came all this way'

180
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,433
to have another go at convincing
me to join your practice.

181
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,400
It was on my way.

182
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,400
I can't appear
too eager with this one.

183
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:16,700
And I can't
be so picky.

184
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,800
It isn't as if
I have other options.

185
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,200
Darling, isn't
that him? Romano?

186
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,200
'Oh, God, don't
let him spot us.'

187
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,433
He keeps leaving
messages about

188
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:28,033
some dreadful lap choley
this afternoon.

189
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,033
Well, he still
is your sponsor.

190
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,500
He only wants me because
he's got a potential partner

191
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,500
keen on seeing
the Aesop in action

192
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,033
and he's not
certified.

193
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:38,066
The Aesop robot? Brilliant.

194
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,333
It galls me
to help him in any way.

195
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:44,133
I wouldn't even give him
the satisfaction of seeing that.

196
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,366
I expect my daughter
to go out fighting.

197
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
Dive in there. Impress
the hell out of Romano.

198
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,133
Make the bugger rue
the day he terminated you.

199
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,033
Yeah. Go for it.

200
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,733
I feel ganged up on.

201
00:08:56,766 --> 00:09:00,066
Lizzie, Peter.
Mr. Corday, what a surprise.

202
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,233
I bet you're
on your way to UCSF.

203
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,300
I came to visit my daughter
while she was still here.

204
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,333
Hmm. You know,
I'm sorry we were..

205
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,300
...unable to continue
the fellowship.

206
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:13,233
I was never fond of her working
with you in the first place.

207
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,300
I recall that.

208
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,233
You got my message about
assisting on the Aesop?

209
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,633
Wouldn't miss it.

210
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,266
Although, um, uh..

211
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,433
...technically, you'll
be assisting me, right?

212
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,333
Well, uh...you got me
on that one.

213
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:32,466
Do you know, I haven't
seen this gadget in action.

214
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,733
If that's alright
with Dr. Romano.

215
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:36,600
I'd be honored.

216
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,500
I should have
brought him in before

217
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,333
but last week,
we visited his cousin

218
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,066
and he seemed better.

219
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,400
‐ Temp's still 100.45.
‐ Where does his cousin live?

220
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,700
‐ Waukegan, right on the lake.
‐ Sounds nice and cool.

221
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,233
Ms. Knight, what tests
would you order?

222
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:53,766
I'd do a full metabolic workup?

223
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,500
'That sounds bad.'

224
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,333
Yeah. I'm gonna try
something else first.

225
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:58,700
Yosh, see if you can
find an electric fan.

226
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,733
There's one in the lounge.

227
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,033
We'll cool the room down

228
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,500
see how that affects
your grandson.

229
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,033
I turn the lights out sometimes
and that seems to help.

230
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,366
Okay. We'll
try that, too.

231
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,500
Uh, we'll be
right back.

232
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,300
You wanna keep
an eye on him? Okay.

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,266
Any questions?

234
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,633
An infant losing
milestones

235
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,300
it sounds like a
metabolic disorder to me.

236
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,400
Look, ordinarily, you'd
be right to check there first

237
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,433
but he's got a fever and in
this heat, he's not even damp.

238
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,100
Why are the lights
out in exam four?

239
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,366
We're cooling
a young boy down

240
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,266
with anhidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia

241
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,733
no sweat glands.

242
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,266
It's just a hunch.
I think it's the right hunch.

243
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,600
You want to look it up.

244
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,066
Hold on, are
you telling me

245
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,200
that the EMS Medical Director

246
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,233
is a real person?

247
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,600
He's an ER Doc.

248
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,633
I thought it
was just a name

249
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,300
they stuck
on the top of memos.

250
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,800
Not when I do it.

251
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,100
Somebody page me?

252
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,733
Yeah, abdominal mass
in trauma one

253
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:52,200
and it sounds like
a Triple A.

254
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,566
What? I pay attention.

255
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,333
Oh and uh, Carla called.

256
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,366
She might not make it to
Reese's ear appointment.

257
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,233
She wants you to leave her
a message if that's a problem.

258
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh. No, that's cool.

259
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,533
Damn, Jerry, what is it,
a hundred degrees in here?

260
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah, I'm on it. I'm on it.

261
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:04,800
Dr. Carter, I'm sorry.

262
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,366
I was with Dr. Ross.

263
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,266
‐ Coffee?
‐ For me?

264
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,633
Can you imagine
me on caffeine?

265
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:13,033
‐ One sugar, right?
‐ Right. Thanks.

266
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:15,133
Hey, why am I already
signed up for two patients?

267
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,500
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

268
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,466
The right arm weakness
could be really interesting.

269
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,166
I ordered up
the previous charts

270
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,700
reviewed them
and did the H and P.

271
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,733
Already?

272
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,166
You want a good residency

273
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,466
you've gotta come
out of the gates flying.

274
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,166
Well, you got a little time

275
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,700
before you need to worry
about that sort of thing.

276
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,366
It's the same for you, isn't it?

277
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,800
Residents start bucking for
chief when they're interns?

278
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,433
You've probably been laying
the groundwork since day one.

279
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,533
Oh, yeah.

280
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:38,633
At school, they said
that's how you

281
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,533
build a career.
Right, Dr. Carter?

282
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,700
Please don't call
him "Dr. Carter."

283
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,066
You'll never be able
to live with him.

284
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
What should I call you?

285
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,133
He's just..."Carter."

286
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:49,466
"Dr. Carter" will be fine.

287
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,266
Oh, God, yeah. Right there.

288
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,033
I was so tense
talking to admin.

289
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,233
I guess you didn't
need to be.

290
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,266
No. I should have asked
for two nurses.

291
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,566
Are you going
to hire yourself?

292
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
No. I'm the only volunteer
I don't mind asking.

293
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,200
Besides, it'll be fun
to hire someone.

294
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,433
Good for the clinic.

295
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,766
‐ There you go. I get it?
‐ Yeah!

296
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,533
Double GSW coming in,
two 16‐year‐olds

297
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,133
one shot through the head,
one through the flank.

298
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,666
Mark, did you
answer the radio?

299
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,333
All by myself.

300
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,133
Single GSW
to the left temporal scalp.

301
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,033
BP is 120 over 78,
pulse 80.

302
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,800
No neuro deficits,
unless being a macho jerk

303
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,733
and attacking your
friendly paramedic counts.

304
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:26,166
She was going for my piece.

305
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
I was going
for your pulse.

306
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,733
You can bleed out next time.

307
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,266
Get that lac taken care of.

308
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,800
Alright, Doris,
I'll look at it. Let's go.

309
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,600
There's no palpable bullet.

310
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:34,700
What's your name, son?

311
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,233
Looks like he's
been shot before.

312
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:38,566
This is my first
time above my neck.

313
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,766
Oh, well, you the man.

314
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,033
Pupils are equal and reactive.

315
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:44,300
‐ You know where you are?
‐ 'Sixteen year old..'

316
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,500
Lil 'Toine, what's up?
Where you been?

317
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,800
Gunshot to the
right buttock.

318
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,133
Single entrance wound.

319
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,033
They capped you in the ass?

320
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:53,633
‐ 'Oh, that's wack.'
‐ Nothing but a thang, BG.

321
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,733
‐ Count. One, two, three.
‐ Two GSWS.

322
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,466
There ought to be
something for us to do.

323
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,700
Maybe a central line,
maybe a chest tube.

324
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,233
I don't know
if I'm ready for that yet.

325
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:03,566
Oh, you aren't.

326
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,433
‐ Pain here?
‐ Nah, man.

327
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,533
I ain't shot there.

328
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,766
Normal sinus
on the scope.

329
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,133
Need any help here?

330
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,733
Dr. Carter,
so glad you asked.

331
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,333
Get some surgilube
and a fresh pair of gloves.

332
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,400
We'll check next door.

333
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,600
Tighter so I can't
open them up.

334
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,766
Anything we
can do in here?

335
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:22,591
I don't need no sister
with no attitude

336
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,758
putting a shot in my head.

337
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,791
Close your eyes, sir.

338
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,825
We haven't finished checking

339
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,325
your cranial nerves.

340
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,158
Looks like they got it
under control.

341
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,658
Don't worry.
There'll be lots of chances.

342
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:32,625
I know.

343
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,158
Sure, the guidelines tell you,
wait until the cops get there

344
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,191
You know, wait until
the scene is secured

345
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,758
but you get there, and some kid
is lying in the street bleeding

346
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,558
what are you going to do?

347
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:43,258
The reason
why I'm curious is

348
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,525
the department's looking

349
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,125
for a new
District Medical Director.

350
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,425
You gonna leave
the ER?

351
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,258
No, no. It'd be
part of my job here.

352
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,191
I thought it'd be a good way
to approach continuity of care.

353
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:57,325
Oh, I hate to see it happen
to such a decent guy.

354
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:58,758
What do you mean?

355
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,358
Seven years,
I've been working on a rig.

356
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,825
Seven years, we've
known that what we need

357
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:04,458
is more paramedics.

358
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:06,258
And every year,
for seven years‐‐

359
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,425
Right, right, right.

360
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,058
They cut the budget.

361
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,491
Uh‐huh.

362
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,391
That part of the job
would not be new.

363
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:17,525
Am I gonna have a scar?

364
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,425
Nah. I'm too good at this.

365
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:21,758
'Get an abdominal CT'

366
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,525
with oral IV
and rectal contrast.

367
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:26,358
If the bullet
hit his colon

368
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:27,491
you'd think he'd
be hurting more.

369
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,225
That kid was masking,
he's in pain.

370
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,525
Hey, how's yours doing?

371
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:32,458
Ah, he's stable,
no blood in the urine

372
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:34,491
stool trace positive
for heme.

373
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,058
You know, I checked
on your probation

374
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:37,591
and it ended yesterday.

375
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,125
Yeah? I guess
the party's over.

376
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:41,358
The committee
required me

377
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:42,725
to sign off
on your patients.

378
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,258
I did not ask
for the job.

379
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,725
Yeah, but you
kind of got off on it, though.

380
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:48,225
I do not relish baby‐sitting.

381
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:49,525
It'd make my life
a lot easier

382
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,125
if everyone did their jobs
on their own.

383
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,691
Oh, Kerry, I'm sorry
to be a burden.

384
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,058
You know what?
This whole thing.

385
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:55,325
It just meant nothing
to you, did it?

386
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,391
It's just, uh, water
under the bridge, right?

387
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:59,291
Oh...I wouldn't say that.

388
00:14:59,325 --> 00:15:01,091
Do you know how many
calls I'm still getting

389
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,358
from people who want
ultra rapid detox?

390
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,391
Forward them to me.
I'll take their calls.

391
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:08,725
Yeah. Can't do that.
God knows what you'd say.

392
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,825
You know, I think
it's a wise move for you.

393
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,291
Great research
opportunities in EMS.

394
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:18,358
I'm actually
more interested

395
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,691
in coordinating
paramedic care.

396
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,291
For once, you and I
would not be in competition.

397
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:24,190
Fieldwork was
never my forte.

398
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,524
You wouldn't want
this job, Kerry.

399
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,224
There's no money,
no power, no glory.

400
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,624
Yeah, right, it doesn't fit
into my Machiavellian scheme

401
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:31,724
to rule the
emergency department.

402
00:15:31,757 --> 00:15:32,790
You heading out?

403
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:34,357
Yeah. Rachel's got
a soccer game.

404
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:39,157
Dr. Weaver,
do you have a minute?

405
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,324
Absolutely.

406
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,757
Jerry, it is
freezing in here.

407
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,457
I know.

408
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,490
I don't know
if you noticed

409
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:45,724
I put in
a salary request.

410
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:46,790
I did.

411
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:48,590
My finances
have changed of late

412
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:49,757
and it's no longer
going to be feasible‐‐

413
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,190
Yeah. I approved it.

414
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:53,824
And frankly,
I was glad to see it.

415
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:55,757
Someone who practices
medicine as a hobby

416
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,590
runs the risk of looking
like a dilettante.

417
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,290
Ah, yes. Well, that's not me.

418
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,090
That's not me, and that's
what's been worrying me

419
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:04,624
is that while I was unpaid,
it held me back

420
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:06,590
from stating
my long‐term goal.

421
00:16:06,624 --> 00:16:08,324
Which is?

422
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,590
I want to be
chief resident.

423
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,624
You don't have to worry
about that quite yet, do you?

424
00:16:12,657 --> 00:16:15,424
No? I want to come
out of the gates strong.

425
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,390
You know it's the only way
to really build a career.

426
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:20,224
Well, you're off to a good
start with your student.

427
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:22,590
Ms. Knight is organized
and in control.

428
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:24,190
Yeah. Lucy's right
on top of it.

429
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,457
A good student is usually
evidence of a good teacher

430
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,657
and that's the first step
toward being a chief.

431
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,457
‐ I say, Jerry‐‐
‐ I'm on it, okay?

432
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,757
'They're turning
it up now.'

433
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,524
I was going to ask you
if you paged me.

434
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,557
'Yeah. That was me.'

435
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,590
Where's the gentleman

436
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:38,624
with the gunshot wound?

437
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,524
Uh, bangers to curtain three.

438
00:16:40,557 --> 00:16:43,090
You know, don't lead her by
the nose too much, your student.

439
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:45,357
I will keep that in mind.

440
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,324
Jerry, it's like
a meat locker in here.

441
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:52,657
Nice work.

442
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,690
Triple A on an anterior left
renal vein is never a picnic.

443
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,624
Yeah, divide and conquer.

444
00:16:57,657 --> 00:16:59,290
What are you doing at 4 o'clock?

445
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:02,490
I've got a tricky
retroperitoneal sarcoma.

446
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:03,824
I was going to run
my son upstairs

447
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,224
for an audiology exam

448
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,590
but I guess I
could reschedule.

449
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,124
Your son have
a hearing problem?

450
00:17:09,157 --> 00:17:10,357
Ah, there was concern.

451
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,590
Turns out he had
fluid in his ears.

452
00:17:11,624 --> 00:17:13,257
I'm just following up.

453
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,657
But he tested
normal at birth?

454
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,690
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Wasn't he a preemie?

455
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:18,424
Yeah. That's right.

456
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:21,357
They sometimes give
gent to preemies.

457
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,057
It can be ototoxic.

458
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,324
No, no. He's fine.

459
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:28,057
He..
I'll be there.

460
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,224
Well, if you're sure.

461
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:35,124
How'd you like to follow up
on Mr. Specchierla in recovery?

462
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,557
Our Triple A.

463
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,824
Oh. Yeah.

464
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,490
I'm on it.

465
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,724
The CT Scan showed
a hole in your rectum.

466
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:46,290
Look like they ripped
you another one Lil 'T.

467
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:49,657
‐ My belly's hurting.
‐ I gave him six of morphine.

468
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,157
Hey, man. Hey, come
check me out, too.

469
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,290
I don't want no dents left
in this pretty head of mine.

470
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,090
Your head
too big, anyway.

471
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:57,790
Are you going to
do my operation?

472
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,590
You don't want
no Chinese fag

473
00:17:59,624 --> 00:18:00,624
messing down there.

474
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:02,657
Japanese.

475
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,557
Your friend could use
a little support.

476
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,390
This isn't a joke.

477
00:18:06,424 --> 00:18:07,557
After the surgery
you're going to have

478
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,790
to wear a colostomy bag.

479
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,557
‐ Do you know what that is?
‐ No.

480
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,190
Lil 'Toine gonna
be crapping in a bag?

481
00:18:16,557 --> 00:18:18,757
Lil 'Toine, you gonna be
crapping in a bag, man.

482
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,790
Not me, man.

483
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:21,157
This is not an accurate

484
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,724
picture of a colostomy.

485
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:26,624
‐ Baby, I heard they shot you.
‐ What you doing here, Moselle?

486
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:29,490
‐ 'She come to see Lil 'Toine.'
‐ Man, I don't think so.

487
00:18:29,524 --> 00:18:31,224
What business is it
of yours who I come to see?

488
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,157
‐ Oh, this is my business, girl!
‐ Chill, girls, chill!

489
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,624
Take it outside,
both of you, now.

490
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,190
Go, go.

491
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,424
We'll explain
the process to you

492
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:41,257
when your mother arrives, okay?

493
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:46,424
'That's what happens when
you run, man. Booty call.'

494
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:49,157
Yosh, get these two
in separate rooms.

495
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,324
Gonna miss that, I bet.

496
00:18:50,357 --> 00:18:51,824
Actually, I will.

497
00:18:51,857 --> 00:18:53,424
He's just a boy.

498
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,090
You know, I was
really sorry to hear

499
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:56,790
that nothing
worked out for you.

500
00:18:56,824 --> 00:18:59,524
Had my fingers crossed
for a faculty spot.

501
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:01,157
But, it wasn't meant to be.

502
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,524
You know, I have heard
of foreign doctors

503
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,557
who were willing
to start over as interns.

504
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,590
‐ Oh, God.
‐ I know. I can't even imagine.

505
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,524
Actually, I do have
one last‐ditch

506
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:13,424
desperate chance in half an hour

507
00:19:13,457 --> 00:19:14,824
so wish me luck.

508
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,757
Call security!

509
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,690
I said, take it outside!

510
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:24,224
‐ Who you talking to?
‐ Shut up!

511
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:26,590
‐ Take it out now. Go.
‐ She crazy, man!

512
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,524
‐ I called security.
‐ And I'm calling the police.

513
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:30,090
You better move fast.
Go, go, go!

514
00:19:30,124 --> 00:19:32,490
‐ Shut up!
‐ Go.

515
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:34,157
'Nice work, Kerry.'

516
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,090
I'm glad I stayed
on your good side.

517
00:19:36,124 --> 00:19:37,657
Excuse me, nurse.
I'm Mr. Savage.

518
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,690
I know you're very busy here but
I've been waiting a long time.

519
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,124
Yeah, well, Mr. Savage,
I am a doctor

520
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,657
and you have to
wait your turn.

521
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,257
‐ You're not a nurse?
‐ Rob Savage?

522
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,624
‐ Yeah.
‐ I have your chart right here.

523
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:52,157
You can't smoke that in here.
Follow me.

524
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,757
'Jerry, get this mess
cleaned up'

525
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,790
and call climate control
to send down some parkas.

526
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,824
You know where
the Rowdies Crush game is?

527
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,157
Just started.

528
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,557
I'm looking
for my daughter's team.

529
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,157
'Yeah, well, there's
girls in this league.'

530
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,057
She's not playing
on a coed team. Rachel!

531
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:15,790
Go! Go all the way, Brandon!

532
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:18,290
Take her. Take her!
She can't stop you!

533
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,457
‐ Easy as pie!
‐ Hang in there, Rach!

534
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,657
‐ 'You'll be fine.'
‐ Take her! Take her!

535
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,390
Tough "D."

536
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,424
‐ Where's the flag?
‐ Flag's right there.

537
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:31,090
Penalty kick!
This one's yours, son.

538
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:32,524
Easy point.

539
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:33,757
She can't stop you.

540
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,590
Goalie's a girl!
Put her away!

541
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:36,624
Hang in there, Rach!

542
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:39,090
'This guy's got nothing!'

543
00:20:39,124 --> 00:20:40,524
Don't worry, Rachel!
Hang in there.

544
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:42,457
It'll be fine!

545
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,290
Hang tough!

546
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,057
Is there a first aid kit?

547
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,324
Sorry to kick so hard.

548
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:07,624
‐ It wasn't that hard.
‐ Hey, you okay?

549
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,657
‐ Dad, you're here.
‐ Yeah.

550
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,557
That was a great save.

551
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,290
That first aid
kit was empty.

552
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:14,690
Does she want some ice?

553
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,557
Uh. Nah, nah, she's tough.

554
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:21,657
Hey, you got leaves
in your hair.

555
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,724
I've had it before.
I‐I just can't pee.

556
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,257
How long has
it been this time?

557
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,824
About two and a half days.

558
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:31,657
It's pretty uncomfortable.

559
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,157
Put this gown on. I'm gonna
go and check with the doctor.

560
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,557
Last time they had
to stick this tube in me.

561
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,090
‐ A Foley catheter?
‐ Yeah.

562
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:39,624
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Having a smoke.

563
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:42,690
‐ You can't smoke!
‐ Not even in here?

564
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:45,690
No. Get undressed.
I'll be right back.

565
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:48,790
'Hold on, hold on.'

566
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,190
‐ 'I got you, sweetheart.'
‐ What's up?

567
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,390
I got you.
Multiple stab wounds.

568
00:21:51,424 --> 00:21:52,590
It happened out in the bay.

569
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:55,524
Oh, man, Weaver kicked
her out of chairs.

570
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,057
Do you know
where she is?

571
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,524
‐ No, I don't.
‐ Page her.

572
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,457
‐ Peter, how have you been?
‐ Oh, good.

573
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,357
I was just checking something
on Reese's chart.

574
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,424
‐ Is he having a problem?
‐ No, he's fine.

575
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:10,157
Well, he did have
an ear infection

576
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,490
but I know he was
given furosemide

577
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:12,690
when he was a neonate.

578
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:15,057
Hmm. He had pulmonary edema.

579
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,424
Yeah and gentamicin
when he was here, right?

580
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:18,490
That's right.

581
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:20,424
Was his hearing
tested then?

582
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:22,057
Ah, right here.

583
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,624
OAE normal screening.

584
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:24,657
Was that testing done

585
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,157
before or after he received

586
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,590
the ototoxic drugs?

587
00:22:27,624 --> 00:22:31,224
Both. And dosages were
in the safe therapeutic range.

588
00:22:31,257 --> 00:22:32,457
Does your son have
a hearing loss?

589
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,524
No, no. I was just
double‐checking.

590
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:37,590
‐ Sorry to bother you.
‐ Not a bother.

591
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,257
BP's up to 85.

592
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,724
‐ 'Chest tube's in.'
‐ Thoraseal to suction.

593
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,490
Why did we put a chest
tube in, Ms. Knight?

594
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:46,790
‐ To re‐expand the lung.
‐ Pulse ox is falling 86.

595
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,190
What the hell?

596
00:22:48,224 --> 00:22:50,257
300 cc's of blood
out of the chest tube.

597
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,424
Alright. Let's check
another hemoglobin.

598
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:54,724
Lucy, draw the blood.

599
00:22:54,757 --> 00:22:57,490
‐ Me?
‐ Yeah.

600
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,524
Damn. Look at that.

601
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,190
Air bubbles.

602
00:23:01,224 --> 00:23:02,657
She's got
sub‐Q emphysema.

603
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,190
Air bubbles from that
stab wound.

604
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:05,690
We're not getting
any oxygen to her lungs.

605
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:07,457
Lucy, get to work.

606
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,057
One cc of venous blood.

607
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,457
'Pulse ox is down to 83.
What's going on?'

608
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,357
She lacerated her main stem
bronchus. Stop bagging.

609
00:23:15,557 --> 00:23:16,590
What are you doing?

610
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:18,524
If I can intubate

611
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:22,224
past the laceration,
we shouldn't have an air leak.

612
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:24,224
You're only ventilating
one lung, Carter.

613
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,757
‐ That's better than none.
‐ Got it.

614
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,090
'I'll check the hemoglobin.'

615
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:30,657
Hey, pulse ox is 90.

616
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,324
No air leak.

617
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,224
‐ Nice work, Carter.
‐ 'Nice work all around.'

618
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:36,524
Alright, call anesthesia.
We need a carlin ET tube.

619
00:23:36,557 --> 00:23:39,757
‐ Hang on. Hemoglobin's 8.9.
‐ What?

620
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,790
‐ 'What was it before?'
‐ '13.7.'

621
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,290
'She dropped her
hemoglobin five points?'

622
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,057
‐ Hang on.
‐ This one lacerated her liver.

623
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,390
Alright, hang two units O‐neg
now. Let's call the OR.

624
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:52,424
Lemme do another hemoglobin.

625
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,757
The machine wasn't calibrated.

626
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,357
What does a sudden
drop in crit indicate?

627
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,257
Ah, intra‐abdominal
hemorrhage?

628
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,757
‐ 'Her vitals are okay.'
‐ Hold up on the O‐neg.

629
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:08,490
‐ Hemoglobin's 12.8.
‐ Well, that's more like it.

630
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,390
Cancel the OR,
send her to CT

631
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,824
Carol, let's get that
machine checked out, huh?

632
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:14,190
‐ Yeah.
‐ You having fun?

633
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,390
Oh, yeah.

634
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:24,390
I knew that.
I knew it.

635
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:26,190
You never do a blood
draw above an IV.

636
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,490
The fluid dilutes
the blood.

637
00:24:27,524 --> 00:24:29,490
That's right.

638
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,824
Thank you for
covering for me.

639
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:33,224
I won't do it again.

640
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:34,624
If you don't
know something, ask.

641
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,390
The docs know
you're learning.

642
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,390
I know, but you're judged
from the word go.

643
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,290
And I just don't want
to look incompetent.

644
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:42,757
You're judged because
it's life or death in here.

645
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,124
I know.

646
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:47,557
I just didn't think
I'd have so much trouble

647
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,157
with simple procedures.

648
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,624
Your problem is you
want to be perfect.

649
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,490
Get over it.
You're a beginner.

650
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,257
It's not gonna be easy.

651
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,590
Last night, I went
to the procedures lab

652
00:24:56,624 --> 00:24:59,157
and I practiced
my IV's on a mannequin

653
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,490
and I got them alright,
every time on the first try.

654
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:03,290
That's good.
You keep it up.

655
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:05,390
But know when
to ask for help.

656
00:25:05,424 --> 00:25:06,724
Hey, you guys
just missed a good one.

657
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,190
Sent a guy straight
up to the OR.

658
00:25:08,224 --> 00:25:09,724
Perfed his intestine
with a carrot.

659
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:11,190
A whole carrot?

660
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:13,190
How do you swallow
a whole carrot?

661
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,224
Didn't swallow.

662
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,557
‐ Oh, I get it.
‐ Yeah.

663
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,324
Oh, God.

664
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,390
Swallowed a carrot.

665
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,257
That is a classic, Lucy.

666
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,524
Hey, can you, uh, work up
this shoulder injury for me?

667
00:25:31,557 --> 00:25:32,657
Yeah.

668
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:36,057
I lucked out getting her,
didn't I?

669
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,724
Yeah. I like her
but she's still a beginner.

670
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:39,190
What do you mean?

671
00:25:39,224 --> 00:25:40,690
I mean, she's getting her
bearings.

672
00:25:40,724 --> 00:25:42,590
She needs guidance,
especially in procedures.

673
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,457
Aw, come on.
Relax, Carol.

674
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,390
Lucy's a natural.
Hell, I'm jealous, too.

675
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:49,190
No, no, no. No, Carter,
you're way off base.

676
00:25:49,224 --> 00:25:50,657
I'm not jealous
at all. I..

677
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:53,824
I don't believe this.

678
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:55,690
Excuse me.

679
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,790
Mr. Savage,
exactly which part

680
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,457
of "no smoking"
didn't you understand?

681
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,557
I have to go now.
My nurse is here.

682
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,657
Give it to me.
What are you, an idiot?

683
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,324
The doctor said I
need a Foley catheter.

684
00:26:08,357 --> 00:26:09,357
Yeah, I'm not so sure
you're going to want me

685
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,424
to put it in, though.

686
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:12,824
‐ I'll be good.
‐ Hand it over.

687
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:15,124
Come on.
The whole pack.

688
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,090
‐ Why?
‐ Because I said so.

689
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,624
Mr. Savage, I'm not going
to wrestle you.

690
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,224
Give me the cigarettes.

691
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:25,190
Now, lie back.

692
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:29,457
What about a rectal?

693
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,057
That's next.

694
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,124
Will it hurt?

695
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:37,590
Only if I want it to.

696
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,524
Aesop, move in.

697
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:46,590
Stop.

698
00:26:46,624 --> 00:26:47,657
'Standing by'

699
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,757
Move left.

700
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,324
‐ Stop.
‐ That is a perfect view.

701
00:26:52,357 --> 00:26:54,090
The arm responds
whenever it's addressed.

702
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:56,624
I'm going to zap this adhesion.

703
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,157
Hold on.
Everybody protected?

704
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,090
Okay. Looks good.

705
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:03,157
Shooting.

706
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,457
Isn't it risky
to use a laser

707
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,524
when contact cautery
would do the job?

708
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,257
Well, you do have
to be precise

709
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,557
shooting but, uh, you can
avoid inadvertent burns..

710
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,457
Angie.

711
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,057
Which you can have
with a Bovie.

712
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,290
Still, I wouldn't want a
KTP laser in the wrong hands.

713
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:21,057
And elevate
the gall bladder.

714
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,124
Mm‐hmm.

715
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:25,624
'Standing by.'

716
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:29,424
Aesop...move back.

717
00:27:29,457 --> 00:27:31,690
Stop.

718
00:27:31,724 --> 00:27:33,757
You make it
look easy, Dr. Corday.

719
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,290
Bet she can walk and chew gum
at the same time, too.

720
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,457
Oh, she can.

721
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,724
'Standing by.'

722
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:45,224
You're saying she's been
stridorous for a month?

723
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:46,757
Uh, the high‐pitched
wheezing when she breathes?

724
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,490
At least.

725
00:27:48,524 --> 00:27:51,457
So, why did it take so long
for you to bring her in?

726
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,657
The other hospital gave her
some stuff for croup

727
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,490
and they said it would help,
but it didn't.

728
00:27:55,524 --> 00:27:57,624
Go like this. Ah, ah.

729
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:59,057
What kind of stuff?

730
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,824
Was it, uh, steroids,
antibiotics?

731
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:03,424
One of them was pink.

732
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:05,224
Well, I don't see
any edema or swelling.

733
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:07,390
Is it possible
she swallowed something?

734
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,690
Maybe. I can't watch
her every moment.

735
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,490
Excuse me. Someone
wants to see you, Doug.

736
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,157
‐ I'm with a patient.
‐ 'Yeah. He's quite insistent.'

737
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,057
Okay.

738
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,724
Alright, we gonna do
some x‐rays of the neck

739
00:28:18,757 --> 00:28:20,790
'and the chest, see if we
can find an obstruction.'

740
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,824
If I don't see anything,
we'll do an endoscopy

741
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:25,257
which is, uh, take a look
down the throat, alright?

742
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,157
I'll be right back.

743
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,257
You know, if you said that to
get a reaction I'm not biting.

744
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,390
‐ Said what?
‐ Endoscopy.

745
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,757
That's pretty invasive.

746
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,457
The kid's been
stridorous for a month.

747
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,824
Hey, Carter, can I
borrow Lucy for a minute?

748
00:28:38,857 --> 00:28:40,124
Sure.

749
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:41,724
Mr. Savage in exam two
needs an IV.

750
00:28:41,757 --> 00:28:43,357
‐ Oh?
‐ No. Don't worry.

751
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,457
This guy's a real pain
in the ass.

752
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,524
Doesn't seem
to feel a thing.

753
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,590
He's perfect for you.

754
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,424
‐ It's you.
‐ That's right.

755
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,324
Hey, I want the treatment.
I got a right.

756
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:51,624
You understand
that I'm a pediatrician.

757
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:53,390
You got that baby clean,
that's what I heard.

758
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:54,790
I can give you names
of some clinics‐‐

759
00:28:54,824 --> 00:28:57,057
No, I can't afford a clinic.
Did you charge the kid?

760
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,524
‐ That was a special case.
‐ No, I'm special!

761
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:00,690
Maybe I don't
look like it to you.

762
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:02,190
I don't treat
adults, okay?

763
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,190
But she said you are the only
one who does it.

764
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:05,657
I don't do it.
I don't do it, okay?

765
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,290
If you have a seat.
I will get you some numbers.

766
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:09,757
I don't want numbers!
I want that detox!

767
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,357
Alright, Kerry,
you made your point.

768
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,324
You know what?
I'm not making a point, Doug.

769
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,057
This is the real
fallout of your actions.

770
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,157
You send all the requests my way
and I'll set them straight.

771
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,624
Yeah, well, a journal article
would reach more people.

772
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:20,357
That guy is gonna be
reading the journals?

773
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,657
Yeah, well, at least you could
justify your decision.

774
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,790
I'm not interested
in justifying anything.

775
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:26,257
I am concerned
if false hopes were raised.

776
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,357
‐ It was one good outcome.
‐ Was it a good outcome?

777
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,657
Mother and baby are
still doing well?

778
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,390
Well, as far
as I know, yes.

779
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:32,824
Yeah, so, follow‐up
care is not part

780
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:34,157
of your extraordinary measures?

781
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,724
I am an ER Doc,
just like you.

782
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,424
Not like me, Doug.

783
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:39,757
You acted without
the consent of your colleagues.

784
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,090
'What have we got?'

785
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:47,624
Thirteen‐year‐old karate student

786
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:50,357
collapsed after his instructor's
demo kick to the chest.

787
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,090
Firefighters were first
on the scene, they started CPR.

788
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,557
We arrived on the scene
about eight minutes after

789
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,057
the call found him apneic
and pulseless

790
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,457
with initial
rhythm of V‐FIB.

791
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,124
‐ Where's the teacher?
‐ He drove behind me.

792
00:29:59,157 --> 00:30:00,557
‐ 'Parents are on the way.'
‐ How long en route?

793
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,490
Seven minutes, about
15 minutes at the scene.

794
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:03,757
He's been down
for 30 minutes.

795
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,290
Okay. Let's go.

796
00:30:05,324 --> 00:30:07,124
One, two, three.

797
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:09,157
Yosh, take over compressions.

798
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,290
Get him on a monitor.

799
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:11,757
Stand by with high‐dose epi.

800
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,190
Good breath sounds
with ventilation.

801
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:14,490
'Nice intubation, Zadro.'

802
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:16,224
'Okay. Hold compressions.'

803
00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:17,824
Is it that sudden death
condition for athletes?

804
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,757
Commotiocordis?
Maybe.

805
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,057
‐ 'Asystole.'
‐ 'Resume compressions.'

806
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,657
'Give him the epi,
four milligrams IV.'

807
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,357
Pupils fixed
and dilated.

808
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,790
I should've just
driven to the morgue.

809
00:30:28,824 --> 00:30:30,657
Let's set up
the external pacemaker.

810
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,157
Put on the pacing pads.

811
00:30:32,824 --> 00:30:34,490
'Carol.'

812
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:37,124
Harriet Goodwyn, Mr. Savage's
private‐duty nurse.

813
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:38,657
He called from here
a little while ago.

814
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,657
‐ I hope I haven't missed him.
‐ No, he's still here.

815
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,757
Did he already have
a Foley Cath?

816
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,590
Well, he complained
of inability to urinate.

817
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:48,090
I'm sorry he did this.

818
00:30:48,124 --> 00:30:49,190
Did what?

819
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,124
Mr. Savage has a problem.

820
00:30:51,157 --> 00:30:53,157
He enjoys procedures

821
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,090
especially when
administered by a nurse.

822
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,790
Oh, my God, I sent
a student in there.

823
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:00,190
‐ Just don't scold him.
‐ I already did that.

824
00:31:00,224 --> 00:31:02,190
That's part
of what he wants.

825
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:03,524
I'm sorry.
I can't get it.

826
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,757
Try the foot.

827
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:10,057
Lucy, you can stop now.

828
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,157
‐ 'Mr. Savage.'
‐ Nurse Goodwyn.

829
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,457
Carol, I couldn't get it.

830
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,757
It's okay. It turns out
he doesn't need it.

831
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,790
Well, Maybe if you
show me again.

832
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:17,290
I'll show you later.
Alright?

833
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:18,624
I think Doug Ross
is looking for you.

834
00:31:20,524 --> 00:31:22,490
It's not Saturday, is it?

835
00:31:22,524 --> 00:31:24,590
‐ It's Thursday.
‐ I just saw you yesterday.

836
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,157
Couldn't you wait?

837
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:28,424
What are you doing?

838
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:29,590
I'm calling
psych down here.

839
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,424
Oh, I can handle this.

840
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,190
Yes. Hello. I need
a psych consult to the ER.

841
00:31:36,224 --> 00:31:39,090
‐ 'Thank you.'
‐ Will you take me home?

842
00:31:39,124 --> 00:31:40,424
We'll see.

843
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:41,457
Look. You can
release him to me.

844
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,790
It's no sweat.

845
00:31:42,824 --> 00:31:44,824
You're not a real RN, are you?

846
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:47,624
My clients like
to think I am.

847
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,724
You might want
to see psych yourself.

848
00:31:51,157 --> 00:31:53,457
Hey, it works for me.

849
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,757
I'm in control.

850
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,590
Yeah. Right.

851
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:01,157
The coach was
going crazy.

852
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,057
Kept saying,
"I barely hit him."

853
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,457
‐ Thirteen years old.
‐ Could happen to my daughter.

854
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,290
About an hour ago,
she got hit in the park.

855
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:09,057
No first aid anywhere.

856
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:12,124
For commotiocordis,
you have to get hit

857
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,624
in just the right spot
on the chest, right?

858
00:32:13,657 --> 00:32:15,290
Yeah, and it's
about timing.

859
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,690
There's a split‐second
upstroke of the T‐wave

860
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,424
when the heartbeat
resets itself.

861
00:32:19,457 --> 00:32:20,790
In that instant

862
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:24,390
a blow will send
the heart into fibrillation.

863
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:27,457
So, by the time
we got there..

864
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,290
Don't fire trucks carry
automated defibrillators?

865
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:33,057
But this one didn't.

866
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,490
That's something
we could change.

867
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,157
We're moving
to the higher frequencies.

868
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,557
Okay.

869
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,090
You may want to use your
earplugs, Dr. Benton.

870
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:44,724
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Thanks.

871
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,424
Four K at 100.

872
00:32:51,724 --> 00:32:53,424
'It's a funny bear, huh?'

873
00:32:53,457 --> 00:32:55,757
Please don't speak
during the test.

874
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,390
Oh. Sorry.

875
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,424
Four K at 90.

876
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:10,690
Four K at 80.

877
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:19,057
Reese, come on,
man, pay attention.

878
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,757
Four K at 85.

879
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:26,690
'Moving to
the Eight‐K frequency.'

880
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,457
Eight K at 90.

881
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,690
Let's try that again.

882
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:47,714
Glad they found you.

883
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:50,147
I was on my way out
when I got the page.

884
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:53,114
Not as sexy as our afternoon
with Aesop, but, hey..

885
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,547
...even a gangbanger
shot in the butt has needs.

886
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:58,147
Yeah. I met
him earlier.

887
00:33:58,181 --> 00:33:59,681
You were outstanding
with Aesop today.

888
00:33:59,714 --> 00:34:02,381
Made me rethink my
decision to let you go.

889
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:03,714
Did it?

890
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,547
I even called upstairs.

891
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:08,447
Unfortunately,
the money's no longer there.

892
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:11,181
I see.

893
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:13,114
Well, maybe you should
apply again next year.

894
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:14,514
Ready?

895
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:15,647
Sure.

896
00:34:17,614 --> 00:34:19,714
Alright. Now,
why are we scoping her?

897
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,647
Her films were negative
and sometimes plastics

898
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:22,781
don't show up in x‐rays.

899
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:24,114
Uh‐huh.

900
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,281
Did you hear the one about the

901
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,314
patient that swallowed a carrot?

902
00:34:27,347 --> 00:34:29,214
Dr. Carter told you.

903
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,147
‐ No, Jerry told me.
‐ Great.

904
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:34,014
I found the mom.
She's out on the phone.

905
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,714
Alright. We'll
have to talk to her.

906
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:38,447
Take a look at that.

907
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,647
It's classic case of
pedunculated papilloma.

908
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:44,047
So, her mother had
a sexually transmitted disease

909
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,114
and the baby caught it
through the birth canal?

910
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:47,481
Gold star.

911
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:51,081
No small bowel injuries.

912
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:52,647
‐ We're ready for a colostomy.
‐ Hold on.

913
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:55,747
The path of the bullet
is awfully close to the ureter.

914
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:59,281
Janet, I need an amp
of IV methylene blue.

915
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,114
Looks to me like the bullet
cleared the ureter.

916
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:02,681
Sometimes you can't
visualize a tear

917
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:05,447
so close to the UV junction.
Fresh lap pad.

918
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:06,581
I'd argue with her,
but I've seen

919
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:07,714
how their soccer fans behave.

920
00:35:07,747 --> 00:35:10,047
GIA stapler, please.

921
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:12,214
You know, if you're
dreading your dinner

922
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:14,081
with your dad, there
are other ways to delay.

923
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,547
I'm looking forward to dinner
with my father, thank you.

924
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,981
‐ I need suction.
‐ Suctioning.

925
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:24,547
So, I expect your father's
eager to have you back.

926
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,281
Didn't he always want
you in his practice?

927
00:35:26,314 --> 00:35:29,081
He has made that
offer before, yes.

928
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:30,414
Kocher.

929
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,147
Terrific specialty,
the heart.

930
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:34,114
Very romantic,
I've always thought

931
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:35,447
but working
with a family member..

932
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:37,147
‐ Shall I Bovie?
‐ Please do.

933
00:35:37,181 --> 00:35:39,114
I couldn't do it,
work with family.

934
00:35:39,147 --> 00:35:42,014
Robert, you can't
work with anyone.

935
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,714
Uh, doctor, there's
blue urine in the Foley bag.

936
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,314
Let's check.

937
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,147
Well, I'll be damned.

938
00:35:52,181 --> 00:35:54,281
I guess the bullet
nicked the ureter after all.

939
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,247
Is she okay?
I wanna see her.

940
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:03,547
She's fine.
She's resting.

941
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,747
Uh, Ms. Brown,
were you ever diagnosed

942
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:08,214
with genital warts?

943
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,581
What's that got to do
with anything?

944
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,047
Have you ever been
treated for any kind of

945
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:13,414
sexually‐transmitted disease?

946
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:14,747
That's none of your business.

947
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,181
Didn't anybody
suggest to you

948
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:17,547
that a C‐section
would prevent you

949
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:18,781
from spreading
the illness to your child?

950
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:20,481
What the hell are you saying?

951
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,147
I'm saying that you
infected your daughter

952
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,381
with human papilloma virus‐‐

953
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,481
My daughter..

954
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:27,214
...is adopted.

955
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:38,047
Ms. Brown, I owe
you an apology.

956
00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:43,681
The loss is more profound
at the higher frequencies.

957
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:45,347
That's a common finding.

958
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:48,747
In lower pitches, Reese begins
perception at 70 decibels

959
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,114
which is considered
a severe loss.

960
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,281
Yeah, but, uh, shouldn't
a doctor take a look at that?

961
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:56,447
He will, and he'll wanna meet
with you but he's in surgery now

962
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,014
and I know you wanted
to hear the results.

963
00:36:58,047 --> 00:37:00,347
Yeah, I did.
Look...I mean..

964
00:37:00,381 --> 00:37:03,147
You're jumping to conclusions
after one subjective test.

965
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:08,481
The good news is that Reese
tests within the audible range.

966
00:37:08,514 --> 00:37:09,747
With digital hearing aids

967
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:12,681
he can be brought up
into this speech banana.

968
00:37:12,714 --> 00:37:16,681
'In this range, he could
develop language skills.'

969
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:18,381
"Could?"

970
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,414
Unaided, Reese can't hear
talking or crying

971
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,247
or the telephone.
It's a severe to profound loss.

972
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,081
You're saying this
after one test.

973
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,147
I mean...look, Reese

974
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,414
wouldn't even wear the headset.

975
00:37:31,447 --> 00:37:32,781
Most toddlers won't.

976
00:37:32,814 --> 00:37:35,181
Two weeks ago, ENT said
it was an ear infection.

977
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:37,214
But his ears are clear now.

978
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:39,047
Okay, look. I don't want
to argue with you, okay?

979
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:41,681
I just want to
talk to a doctor..

980
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:43,081
As soon as possible.

981
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:45,347
Okay. We'll set that up.

982
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,581
‐ Did I miss Doug?
‐ Uh, yeah, just.

983
00:37:47,614 --> 00:37:50,147
He went up to Pedes
to talk to Alex Babcock.

984
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:51,747
The pediatric anesthesiologist?

985
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:52,781
What's that about?

986
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:54,014
You know, Kerry, you'd probably

987
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:55,047
have to ask him that.

988
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:58,281
You know, you are up so right.

989
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:00,147
Could you tell him that I can't
make the tea time tomorrow?

990
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,147
Rachel's got soccer practice,
I don't wanna miss it.

991
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:03,414
Good for you, Mark.

992
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,514
Has anybody noticed
the temperature in here?

993
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,647
It feels like a perfect
72 degrees.

994
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,281
Actually, I was thinking
it was a little‐‐

995
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:10,314
‐ Stuffy.
‐ Chilly.

996
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,514
Good day today, Lucy.

997
00:38:11,547 --> 00:38:13,147
‐ Don't work too late.
‐ I won't.

998
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:14,481
Somebody's got to be
bright‐eyed tomorrow.

999
00:38:14,514 --> 00:38:16,714
‐ I will be.
‐ Did you even eat today?

1000
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:19,047
You know, if you're hungry,
I didn't finish my lunch.

1001
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,081
Oh, no. I'm okay.

1002
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:21,481
Well, all I have is a carrot.

1003
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:24,747
Okay. So I'm an idiot.

1004
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:27,447
‐ What? What's up?
‐ Manana.

1005
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:33,347
‐ Carol Hathaway?
‐ That's me.

1006
00:38:33,381 --> 00:38:34,681
Lynette Evans.

1007
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:37,614
I've been working per diem
up on the third floor.

1008
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,314
And Don Anspaugh hasn't
told you a word about me yet.

1009
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:41,747
Oh, I'm afraid not.

1010
00:38:41,781 --> 00:38:44,514
What can you expect of admin
besides dropping the ball?

1011
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:46,114
He was supposed
to come down here

1012
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:48,381
and blow my horn so I
wouldn't have to do it myself.

1013
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,214
Well, anyway
I hear you have an opening

1014
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,614
for a nurse practitioner
in your clinic.

1015
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:53,181
Oh, I'd settle for an RN

1016
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,781
our budget just got
approved today.

1017
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:57,347
Well, a nurse practitioner,
which I am, by the way

1018
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:58,514
would serve you better.

1019
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,247
Well, since I can write
prescriptions

1020
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:02,681
and I know from time to time
you can't call any docs.

1021
00:39:02,714 --> 00:39:04,314
Have you worked
here already?

1022
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:06,681
No. I've ran my own clinic
Southside before it closed.

1023
00:39:06,714 --> 00:39:08,147
That's where I know Don.

1024
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,314
Oh, right. I heard
about that clinic.

1025
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:13,781
Bye for now, suckas.
See you next time.

1026
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:16,481
Are you talking
to anybody in particular?

1027
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:17,581
You addressing
the nurses

1028
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:19,414
and doctors who
took care of you?

1029
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,214
What you do,
fall on that head?

1030
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:24,081
‐ No, I got shot.
‐ I beg your pardon?

1031
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,647
I got shot, ma'am.

1032
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:27,481
Then I think
you'd better say.

1033
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:29,681
"Thank you for saving
my sorry life."

1034
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:31,347
She wasn't my nurse.

1035
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:33,114
At the rate you're going,
she will be next time.

1036
00:39:33,147 --> 00:39:34,481
Just say it.

1037
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:38,347
Thank you
for saving my life.

1038
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:39,581
You're welcome.

1039
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,047
All that boy needs is somebody
to smack him upside his head.

1040
00:39:47,047 --> 00:39:49,647
Um...here's my number.

1041
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,414
‐ Keep me in mind
‐ I will.

1042
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:54,714
In fact, um..

1043
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:57,581
I think you're great.

1044
00:39:58,814 --> 00:40:01,347
And, uh, actually..

1045
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:02,747
...I‐I shouldn't
waste our time.

1046
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:04,714
I'm just going to, um..

1047
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:07,081
I'll hire you
right now.

1048
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,114
Oh, I'm gonna like
your style.

1049
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:10,147
Oh...great.

1050
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,647
Good.

1051
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,747
'No. Adele Neumann thought
you might know something.'

1052
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,581
‐ Was Adele the social worker?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

1053
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:20,614
Yeah, I called her
when the mom failed

1054
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:23,547
to bring baby Josh in for
his follow‐up appointment.

1055
00:40:23,581 --> 00:40:25,447
It was two weeks ago.

1056
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:26,614
So they disappeared.

1057
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:28,081
It's not necessarily bad news.

1058
00:40:28,114 --> 00:40:29,747
I don't know the mom's a junkie.

1059
00:40:29,781 --> 00:40:31,481
Well, she had a sister
in the Carolinas

1060
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,714
who sounded pretty stable.

1061
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:36,381
For Josh's sake, I'm hoping
that's where they wound up.

1062
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:39,147
I guess I'm just lucky
she doesn't want to sue me.

1063
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:42,047
I think she appreciated
what you did for her baby.

1064
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,081
Enough to take care
of him herself?

1065
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:46,047
'Dr. Ross.'

1066
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,547
Remember me?
You're Dr. Ross, right?

1067
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,014
Oh, yeah, you're
the skateboard champ, right?

1068
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,381
Fractured your arm.

1069
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:53,481
Good thing you were
wearing a helmet.

1070
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,147
Yeah. That's me.

1071
00:40:55,181 --> 00:40:56,347
What are you doing here?

1072
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,181
You should have seen
Ruben two days ago.

1073
00:40:58,214 --> 00:41:00,347
‐ 'My arm was killing me.'
‐ Yeah?

1074
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:02,381
Yeah, I mean, you
couldn't even touch me.

1075
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:03,747
Like that it hurt so bad.

1076
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,347
Yeah. You were
in rough shape.

1077
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,014
From the fracture?

1078
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,781
He'd been on morphine
for months with no relief.

1079
00:41:09,814 --> 00:41:11,681
‐ Sounds like neuropathic pain.
‐ Exactly.

1080
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:13,214
My brain was, like..

1081
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:14,747
...getting
its signals crossed.

1082
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,747
‐ Switch to gabapentin?
‐ Yep.

1083
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,414
Got to know what kind
of pain you're dealing with.

1084
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:25,081
So, what you're saying is
you saved two lives today.

1085
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:26,747
Well, I saved the boy
from sepsis

1086
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:29,681
and a second trip
to the OR, at least.

1087
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:32,014
To a wonderful doctor.

1088
00:41:32,047 --> 00:41:33,114
Oh.

1089
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,114
And a partner
I'd be proud to have.

1090
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:42,014
Actually, daddy, uh..

1091
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,514
I'm gonna have
to turn you down.

1092
00:41:44,547 --> 00:41:47,114
I know this doesn't
make much sense

1093
00:41:47,147 --> 00:41:49,314
but I have given it
a lot of thought.

1094
00:41:51,114 --> 00:41:53,414
After we sewed up
that gangbanger..

1095
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:55,081
I mean, it wasn't
a fancy save.

1096
00:41:55,114 --> 00:41:56,614
It wasn't high‐tech..

1097
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,714
...in fact, it was
the kind of surgery

1098
00:41:58,747 --> 00:42:02,314
one could almost
do as an intern.

1099
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:05,547
You're not thinking
of starting all over again.

1100
00:42:05,581 --> 00:42:07,181
'Why not?'

1101
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:10,781
I mean, yes, it will
be a blow to my ego

1102
00:42:10,814 --> 00:42:14,014
but on the other hand, I'll
be practicing medicine still.

1103
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:18,214
It's not so shabby,
saving lives

1104
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,281
and it's a means to what
I really want to do

1105
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:22,047
which is to stay here.

1106
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:27,381
How much does Peter Benton
figure in this plan?

1107
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,581
I have to be
a little protective

1108
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,481
after he stood us up tonight.

1109
00:42:33,481 --> 00:42:35,047
Peter's complicated.

1110
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:37,081
He had something
else on his mind

1111
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:39,581
and you know I'd never make
a decision based on a man.

1112
00:42:41,114 --> 00:42:42,181
That said..

1113
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,781
I don't know what to say.

1114
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:53,147
I could never have tolerated
going back to the beginning

1115
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:56,447
not once I'd finished
the fifth year.

1116
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,414
It'll only be for a year
and then I'll have a license

1117
00:42:58,447 --> 00:42:59,714
to practice here.

1118
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,747
Does it seem like
I'm giving up?

1119
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:07,247
On the contrary. I've never
seen you fight harder.

1120
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:10,181
Thank you.

1121
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,681
Reese..

1122
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,381
Come on, man.
