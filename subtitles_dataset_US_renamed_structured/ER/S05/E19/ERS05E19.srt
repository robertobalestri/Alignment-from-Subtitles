1
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:06,766
Previously on "ER"

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,766
No!

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Give him back to me!
Give him to me! Coco.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,300
Group therapy
in your first week?

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,500
God, all I did
was observe the

6
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,266
first two weeks of
my psych rotation.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,600
I'm going to have a baby.

8
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,733
I heard there might
be a surgical trauma

9
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,433
fellowship run
out of the ER.

10
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,800
It was my idea.

11
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,266
I brought it to
Greene and Weaver.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,533
I‐I need time for Reese.

13
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:29,133
Don't use him as an excuse
to screw me over.

14
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,400
I'll find something else.

15
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,133
No, no, I don't want you
to forfeit it to me.

16
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,266
If you want it,
by all means, you go for it.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,766
I'll still get it.

18
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,733
‐ Morning, Carol.
‐ Morning.

19
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,033
Did you see that
beautiful blue sky?

20
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,300
Oh, not yet. I came in
when it was still dark.

21
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,433
‐ Cracker?
‐ No, thanks.

22
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:03,633
What are you doing?

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,100
I woke up with
an urge to clean.

24
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,400
Do you realize this
peritoneal lavage kit

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,133
expired in 1996?

26
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,133
Listen, if your
symptoms persist

27
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,700
maybe you could work
your magic on the admit area.

28
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:16,366
Yeah, I think I've, uh,
been cured, thanks.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,733
Well, it's worth a shot.

30
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,700
‐ Morning, doc.
‐ Morning.

31
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:27,066
‐ Whoa.
‐ I'm sorry. Excuse me.

32
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
Uh, no, it's my fault. I wasn't
looking where I was going.

33
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,766
You're looking bright.

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Oh, well, uh, yeah

35
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,666
I'm presenting on a
panel this afternoon

36
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,233
at the Chicago Society
Of Trauma Physicians.

37
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:37,133
Well, I'll stop griping
about having to attend.

38
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,166
What's your topic?

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,266
Ultrasound versus CT

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,566
in blunt abdominal trauma.

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,233
Got some promising
findings, actually.

42
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:43,633
I look forward to it.

43
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,500
Ow!

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,366
Hey, man, you want to try
getting it to me next time?

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,433
Proper way
to throw a Frisbee

46
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,633
is off the middle finger,
side‐arm.

47
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,066
For me, it's the, uh

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,633
flick of the wrist
that gives it that rotation.

49
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,500
Great catch.

50
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,000
For me, the key to Frisbee
is a light touch.

51
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:18,500
So you're on
your way to work.

52
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,466
Yes, my shift begins
in 15 minutes

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,366
and today's my last day.

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,333
Oh, I thought everything
was going well with the INS.

55
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:30,333
Oh, it is. I got amnesty.

56
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,300
‐ Congratulations.
‐ Thank you.

57
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm going to school to get my
civil engineering license.

58
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,800
You and Kubby are gonna
stay here in Chicago?

59
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,533
‐ Yes.
‐ Great.

60
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:44,366
Carol, do you know anything
about this woman, Coco Robbins?

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,700
Oh, yeah. Her and her baby
are coming into the

62
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,233
clinic today, right?

63
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:49,400
She's schizophrenic
and social services

64
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,300
is having us monitor
her baby care?

65
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,266
Well, I had to make sure
she's taking her meds.

66
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Well, it's a pretty risky
proposition, isn't it?

67
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,033
She deserves a chance.

68
00:02:57,066 --> 00:03:00,033
So this was your idea?

69
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,166
Don't worry about it, Lynette.

70
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,466
I am in touch
with the halfway house

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,133
where her
and her baby are living.

72
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,533
And I'll volunteer to be there
for all her appointments.

73
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:10,066
You asked me to be responsible
for the clinic, remember?

74
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,466
And I didn't know
anything about this.

75
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,066
You're right.

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,700
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,633
I should have told you about
the arrangements I'd made.

78
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,566
No, Carol.
You should have asked.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,166
She's due in a few minutes.

80
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:22,033
Hey, what are you guys doing?

81
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,166
Drafting teams for
rotisserie baseball.

82
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,366
Do you want in?

83
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,700
Oh, can I, uh,
draft Ken Griffey?

84
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,600
‐ He's mine.
‐ I already got Sammy Sosa.

85
00:04:27,633 --> 00:04:29,700
'Cause he's got
the cutest buns in baseball.

86
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,733
Carter! How would you like
to perform a righteous act

87
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,133
and make me
a happy man all at once?

88
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,466
Alright.

89
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,533
Dean signed us on
for a mentoring project

90
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,466
at the Math‐Science
Magnet School.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,733
It's PR, you know,
they put some of their

92
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:43,266
top high school students
into area hospitals

93
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,666
like a, uh, an independent
study program.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,366
So we're getting one
whether we like it or not.

95
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,700
What I need you
to do is hold his hand

96
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,800
and give him
a few errands to run.

97
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,400
‐ Ah, okay.
‐ Good.

98
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,266
Uh, it is a public school,
but I'm assured

99
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,033
that the kid is not
a convicted felon.

100
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,300
When's this all
supposed to take place?

101
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:58,466
Any time now.

102
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,666
Kid's name is Antoine.

103
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,333
‐ Oh, today?
‐ Yeah.

104
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,700
And don't
leave him unattended

105
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,266
around the drug lockup.

106
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,033
‐ Thank you.
‐ What's wrong?

107
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,200
Uh, nothing.
Are you back with us?

108
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:09,466
No, I'm still in psych.

109
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,233
You'll be back
doing real medicine soon

110
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,466
so don't get too used
to the cush life.

111
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Yeah, I won't.

112
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,533
Sally McKenna?

113
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,100
Did they get the glass
out of his eye?

114
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,433
The doctor's still
with your husband.

115
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,533
My name is Lucy Knight.

116
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,333
I'm a student doctor
in psychiatry.

117
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,633
Can I ask you
a few questions?

118
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,333
Listen, Michael's
been very stressed out.

119
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,700
I mean, he's in law school

120
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,500
um, but he's never done
anything like this before.

121
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,033
The doctor said
he attacked a car?

122
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,133
He was working on a paper
for the last few days

123
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,333
so I‐I left him alone,
and today I woke up

124
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:38,366
and‐and he was in the street
smashing our car

125
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,133
with an aluminum bat.

126
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,333
And does Michael
have any history

127
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:42,366
of psychiatric problems?

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,466
No, not at all.

129
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Michael ever
use any drugs?

130
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,166
No. Never.

131
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,333
I mean, he'll drink a few beers,
but I mean, a few beers

132
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:52,366
doesn't make a person freak out
like that, you know.

133
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,466
I mean, I‐I think it's just,
it's just a build up of stress.

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,033
Well, I will go talk
to your husband

135
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,500
as soon as the ER docs
are done with him.

136
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,700
'Hey, Jeanie.'

137
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,333
‐ Still doing triage?
‐ Uh‐huh.

138
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,633
‐ So, how you feeling?
‐ Not bad.

139
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,233
Any, uh, side effects
from the ribavirin?

140
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,500
No.

141
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:12,066
Nausea? Fatigue?

142
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,566
Peter, please. I'm fine.

143
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Well, you look a little tired.

144
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,466
Listen, why don't you
let me check your LFT's

145
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,600
if the hep meds aren't working

146
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,100
then, the sooner
we know, the better.

147
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:22,500
I've got a lab appointment
this afternoon.

148
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,766
Listen, if, um, you
know, if you need me..

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,300
Thanks. Excuse me, I've got
patients I need to triage.

150
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:31,066
Carol, your appointment
hasn't shown up.

151
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
What?

152
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,133
Coco Robbins and her baby

153
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,566
they're late.

154
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,800
‐ Did she call?
‐ No, but I tried calling her.

155
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,166
No one at the halfway house
has seen her all morning.

156
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,533
Maybe I should go over there.

157
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,800
Maybe you should
call children

158
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,766
and family services
or the police.

159
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,533
God, I didn't think
she'd do this.

160
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:47,633
If she doesn't stay on meds,
there's nothing we can do.

161
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,533
'Hey, Carol.'

162
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,300
There's someone here
to see you, a Coco Robbins.

163
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,700
Coco.

164
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,433
Are you all right?
Where have you been?

165
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,366
On my way here.
I know I'm early

166
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,033
but I wasn't sure
I should bother you.

167
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:05,666
‐ Early?
‐ 12:00 noon?

168
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,266
Yeah, they wrote
it down for me.

169
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh. I must have written
it down wrong in the book.

170
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,666
Is it still okay?

171
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,133
Yeah, it's fine.

172
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,666
Nurse Hathaway will take
you into the clinic.

173
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,600
‐ Come on, Coco. How's he doing?
‐ Really good.

174
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,533
‐ He's so beautiful, isn't he?
‐ He is beautiful.

175
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:26,333
‐ Morning, Peter.
‐ Hey.

176
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,033
I understand the trauma
fellowship's going to happen.

177
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:31,700
And Anspaugh's made
a formal announcement.

178
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,233
Look, I'm‐I'm sorry
I came down so hard on you

179
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:39,100
about your interest.

180
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,233
It was really
silly of me to be

181
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:42,733
so proprietary about it.

182
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,266
Well, apparently
they're expecting

183
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,766
at least 15 applicants.

184
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Really?

185
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:52,066
So, um, have you given up
the cardiothoracic?

186
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,266
'Hmm?'

187
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,500
Haven't made up my mind yet.

188
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,500
Well, by all means
feel free to apply

189
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,700
for the trauma fellowship.

190
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,666
I appreciate that.

191
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,433
If you do,
we have the inside track.

192
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,700
You know, home team advantage.

193
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:11,633
Yeah.

194
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,033
So, um,
are you planning on going

195
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,266
to the trauma conference
this afternoon?

196
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,566
No, I couldn't get away.

197
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,433
Romano has me doing
a keyhole cardiac bypass.

198
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,433
Oh, very fancy.

199
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:23,766
Well, I don't think
you'll be missing much.

200
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,100
I understand it's
a rather dull affair.

201
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,666
Yeah, yeah, probably.

202
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,433
Okay. Well, if you'll excuse me

203
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:36,166
I have a partial gastrectomy
to get to.

204
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,033
Lucy, tell me
about Michael McKenna

205
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,166
that patient who
smashed up his car.

206
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,500
I was just
going in to see him.

207
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,533
You haven't worked
him up yet?

208
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,100
The ER just
got done with him.

209
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:44,500
Okay, Lucy, what I need
you for is to pull

210
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,233
all the information
and present the patient

211
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:47,566
so I can come down
and quickly decide

212
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,466
if they need to be
admitted or medicated.

213
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,233
How long do you expect it will
take you to get to Mr. McKenna?

214
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,800
‐ 15 minutes.
‐ I'll see you in ten.

215
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,366
Enjoying your psych rotation?

216
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,600
I guess you heard that.

217
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:58,500
A little advice,
as a med student

218
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,366
your job is to get
to know patients

219
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,233
not be hand servant
to your resident

220
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,566
and work up all
his patients for him.

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,300
But the med students
who help their residents

222
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,333
get better grades.

223
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:08,133
Now is the time to learn about

224
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,800
talking and listening
to patients.

225
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,033
Don't let that
get lost in the shuffle.

226
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,666
‐ Right. Thanks.
‐ You're welcome.

227
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,333
Her chest sounds
a little tight.

228
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,166
She'll need to stay for
an albuterol treatment.

229
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,633
‐ 'Will she be okay?'
‐ She'll be fine.

230
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,266
Hey, Nita. It's
Reverend Lynn.

231
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,033
Would you cancel
all my morning appointments?

232
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,766
Yeah, looks like
I'll be here for a while.

233
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,400
Yeah, right. Bye.

234
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,800
Sorry this is
taking so long.

235
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,300
You're obviously busy.

236
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,500
I can wait.

237
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,400
How'd you do that
to your thumb?

238
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,766
Hammering the gutter
on my church.

239
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,533
It hurts like hell.

240
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,666
‐ I'm Matthew Lynn.
‐ Hi. Jeanie Boulet.

241
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,666
‐ You're a minister?
‐ South street AME.

242
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Do you know it?

243
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,433
I'm not much
of a church goer.

244
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,566
I had my fill as a child
being told what I couldn't do.

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I hear you.

246
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:59,633
You have
a subungual hematoma

247
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,600
a collection of blood
under your nail.

248
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,366
It's a simple procedure
to drain it

249
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,633
so I will call a doctor

250
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,133
and give you something
for the pain.

251
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,366
Looks like you also have
some swollen joints.

252
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,133
Rheumatoid arthritis.
I've had it for years.

253
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,766
I take a bunch of pills
for the inflammation

254
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,666
then I take another bunch
to keep the first bunch

255
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,366
from giving me an ulcer.

256
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,666
That's not much fun.

257
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,033
Oh, I'm pretty lucky.

258
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,533
I've seen worse.

259
00:10:22,566 --> 00:10:24,266
Well, I would lay off
the hammering for a while.

260
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I don't want you having
another accident.

261
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,533
I don't believe in accidents.

262
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:32,233
If I hadn't hit my thumb,
we would never have met.

263
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,033
So this is
a divine intervention.

264
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,266
Something like that.

265
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
‐ You Antoine Bell?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

266
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,533
Ah, I'm Dr. Carter.

267
00:10:40,566 --> 00:10:41,800
‐ How you doing?
‐ Alright.

268
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,033
You'll be spending
some time with us

269
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,266
this next couple
of weeks, huh?

270
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,400
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Come on, I'll show you around.

271
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:49,600
Well, it's slow right now
but that can always change.

272
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,100
Sorry, I can't make
the trauma conference.

273
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:54,233
I have a conflict
with the executive committee.

274
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:56,633
I'll cauterize that bleeder
in the abdominal wall.

275
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,700
Mm‐hmm.

276
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,566
If you like, I can leave a copy

277
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,333
of my talk in your office.

278
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,166
You know, I found the positive
predictive value of ultrasound

279
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,366
is actually higher
than previously reported.

280
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,566
Excellent.

281
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,766
And by the way
what did you think

282
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,700
of, uh, Peter's study?

283
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,366
Oh, he told me
he wasn't presenting today.

284
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,533
No, no, no, I'm talking
about the sternal saw paper

285
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,266
he and Kerry Weaver
had accepted

286
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,466
by the Annals
Of Emergency Medicine.

287
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,266
‐ Quite provocative.
‐ Really?

288
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,233
Yes, it could attract
the grant money we'll be needing

289
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,133
to keep the trauma
fellowship running.

290
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,200
Hmm.

291
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,600
I look forward to reading it.

292
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,233
'Michael? Hi.'

293
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,633
I'm Lucy Knight.

294
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:46,033
‐ How are you feeling?
‐ Pretty embarrassed.

295
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:49,433
I'm from psychiatry and I just
wanna talk to you briefly.

296
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:52,800
So, law school's been pretty
rough going, your wife said?

297
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,633
It has, but I got out of my
system what I needed to get out

298
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,166
and I'm fine now.

299
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,100
I've felt like
smashing things before.

300
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,466
What got you to the point
where you actually did it?

301
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,633
Uh, you know,
pressure, uh, things.

302
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:11,333
And how have the
last few days been?

303
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:15,200
Just, formulating my thoughts.

304
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:19,533
And how do you cope
with your stress, usually?

305
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:21,566
Not much can be done.

306
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Do you ever
have a drink?

307
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,333
Maybe a few beers?

308
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,733
I‐I do.

309
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:28,233
And have you been
drinking more recently

310
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:32,066
to cope with
the stress?

311
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
How much have you had to drink
in the last few days?

312
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,400
Drinking...helps.

313
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,700
Oh, god.

314
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,666
It‐it helps you relax?

315
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,466
Uh, It helps 'em be..

316
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,533
...more quiet.

317
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,200
Who does it make more quiet?

318
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,733
My demons.

319
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,733
You don't believe me, but..

320
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:00,766
...I hear them.

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,666
Are you hearing them now?

322
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,266
Michael?

323
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
I'll call Dr. Myers.

324
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,166
I would never hurt my wife.

325
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,333
I'm stronger than they are.

326
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:13,766
They..
I wouldn't do what they said.

327
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,566
I hit the car instead.

328
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,666
They wanted me
to do it to her, but..

329
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,200
...I hit the car.

330
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
He took three ounces
of Enfamil 20 with iron

331
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:35,766
at 4:25 this morning
and he burped at 4:47.

332
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
He peed at 5:05...

333
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,366
you're writing this all down?

334
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,200
‐ Is that okay?
‐ Of course.

335
00:13:41,233 --> 00:13:42,433
I just want to make sure people

336
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:45,300
see that I'm getting
it all right.

337
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,266
‐ Look.
‐ Could you listen to his heart?

338
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,666
It beats so fast.

339
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,400
Babies' hearts
beat faster than adults.

340
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,200
It's perfectly normal.

341
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,566
'Oh, good, I just,
I thought maybe something'

342
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,800
was wrong, which is why
I came a little early.

343
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,066
No, he's fine.
Aren't you?

344
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,300
Sometimes he spits up
a little after he eats.

345
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,509
Mm‐hmm, which is
perfectly normal

346
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,642
for a happy, healthy baby.

347
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:13,476
You can relax, Coco,
he's doing great.

348
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,109
And you're doing great.

349
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:18,176
I think he's
a very lucky little boy.

350
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,642
I have to do right with this.

351
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,542
Better than..
Better than right.

352
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:25,642
I know, and you are.

353
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,776
If something goes wrong,
I know I'll lose him.

354
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,342
You taking your meds?

355
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:31,742
Yeah, yeah. It's right here.
Look at my journal.

356
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:37,709
Everything's going good
at the halfway house?

357
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:42,709
Great. There's another woman
there with a two‐month‐old girl.

358
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,676
Everyone's so nice.

359
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,609
They just love having
these little babies around.

360
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,576
What's not to love?

361
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,709
Any questions?

362
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,109
You'll be back in two days?

363
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:57,642
Two days, 10:00 a.m.
I'll be here.

364
00:14:57,676 --> 00:14:59,509
You'll have to do better
controlling your temper

365
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,342
Mr. Pipitone, no more
putting your foot

366
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:02,642
through picture frames.

367
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:04,476
Yeah, my passion got
the better of me.

368
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:06,076
What can I tell you?

369
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,376
She's lucky that's all
I put my foot through.

370
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,442
‐ You married?
‐ Divorced.

371
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,609
‐ Dating anybody steady?
‐ Not right now.

372
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:14,742
There you go, fast and loose.

373
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:17,309
Don't let them get
their hooks into you.

374
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:19,709
From the age they grow boobs
till the day they die

375
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,242
they can make you crazy.

376
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:25,142
‐ Do I tell the truth?
‐ Yep.

377
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,376
Alright, it looks like
you're going to have

378
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,476
to stay off this foot
for a couple of weeks.

379
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,742
A couple of weeks?
No, doc, I can't do that.

380
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,642
I got to get back out
on the dance floor.

381
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:36,076
I go ballroom dancing
a couple, three times a week.

382
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,709
'Really?'

383
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,509
‐ You dance?
‐ No.

384
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,142
What you got
against dancing?

385
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:43,509
It'll turn you
into a chick magnet.

386
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,376
I'd like to dance.
I just never learned how.

387
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:49,276
Except for my wedding.
I learned to tango.

388
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:50,309
Ah, the tango.

389
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:52,242
You know what I mean.

390
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:54,276
Alright, Mr. Pipitone.

391
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,742
I'll check in
with you later.

392
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:57,142
Two weeks, huh?

393
00:15:57,176 --> 00:15:58,742
‐ Uh, with the foot?
‐ Two weeks.

394
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,342
Hey, Carter. Where's your
scared straight kid?

395
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,342
I wanna give him the obligatory
tour of the morgue.

396
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:04,676
He's not a scared straight kid.

397
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:05,709
He's from the Math‐Science
Magnet School.

398
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:07,209
Really?

399
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:08,342
Who said he was
a scared straight kid?

400
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,609
No one. My mistake.

401
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,442
If you see him, tell him
I'm looking for him.

402
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,442
Hey, Antoine, we got
a trauma coming in.

403
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,609
Paramedics are bringing in
a stabbing victim.

404
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:21,276
We're going to take him into
that trauma room right there

405
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,209
and I want you to follow
along, alright?

406
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,676
‐ Just hang back.
‐ Alright.

407
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,442
Seth Willows?

408
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:29,542
Here we are.

409
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,276
Mrs. Willows?

410
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,142
No. My name is
Leila Morgan.

411
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,742
This is my
foster son, Seth.

412
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,242
Hi, Seth.
I'm nurse Hathaway.

413
00:16:38,276 --> 00:16:39,342
'What happened here?'

414
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:41,642
He put his hand
through a window.

415
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,142
‐ Can I take a look?
‐ No.

416
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,142
‐ It won't hurt.
‐ No!

417
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:46,676
Seth, stop.
Stop this!

418
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,409
‐ Carol, you okay?
‐ Yep.

419
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,142
Okay, Seth
why don't you take a seat?

420
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:55,642
Sit down right
there now, please.

421
00:16:55,676 --> 00:16:57,309
I'm so sorry.

422
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:59,276
We're having such trouble
with him.

423
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,642
I'm gonna get him into an exam
room take a look at the hand.

424
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,709
I'm also going to call
for a psych consult.

425
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:05,676
We got a 55 year old man
stabbed in the neck

426
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:08,776
during a robbery,
BP's 135/82, pulse 110.

427
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,342
Airway seems okay.

428
00:17:10,376 --> 00:17:11,642
Alright, we got
a zone two neck injury.

429
00:17:11,676 --> 00:17:13,376
Good carotid pulse.
Can you see?

430
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:16,176
What else about the third man?
Was he big, small?

431
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,342
‐ Skinny, not big.
‐ 'Excuse me, sir.'

432
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:19,776
Are you usually
hoarse like this?

433
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,209
No.

434
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:22,476
Alright, could be
a nerve injury.

435
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,209
Yeah, or an expanding hematoma.
Call X‐ray.

436
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,209
I need a neck film.

437
00:17:27,376 --> 00:17:29,009
Pulse ox 96.

438
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:30,309
'You wanna explore
him in the OR?'

439
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,542
'No, he's pretty stable.'

440
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:32,609
Skinny and what
else, Mr. Cho?

441
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:33,642
What was he wearing?

442
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:35,609
I don't know. Dark clothes.

443
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:38,742
Alright, on my count.
One, two, three.

444
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,176
He needs a tetanus booster.
Gram of ancef?

445
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,176
No, let's give him
three of unasyn.

446
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,742
‐ Why wasn't I paged?
‐ Didn't need you.

447
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:47,376
Okay, here's the plan.
Chest is clear.

448
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:51,076
We need an angiography,
esophagoscopy, laryngoscopy.

449
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,676
Well, I think we should
protect his airway first.

450
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,709
Hold on, hold on, I'm covering
the ER, alright?

451
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:57,242
Fine. I'm finished here.

452
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,376
'Chuny, draw up four of versed
and ten of Norcuron.'

453
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:01,009
Sir, we're giving
you some medicine.

454
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,276
'It's gonna make you sleep,
when you wake up'

455
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:03,342
there's gonna be a tube
in your mouth.

456
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:04,676
And you won't be able to speak.

457
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,409
No, no, I got to finish
with the descriptions.

458
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:07,576
No, he needs
to be sedated and intubated.

459
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:08,642
His wife is DOA at the scene

460
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,109
the killers are at large.

461
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,142
Just give me a minute
to get all the

462
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,276
description that he can give us.

463
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:13,342
Please.

464
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,442
Alright.

465
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:19,076
Mr. Cho, the teenager

466
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,109
was he dark‐skinned?
Light‐skinned?

467
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,476
'Medium.'

468
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:26,542
Going my way?

469
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:29,442
If you're going
up to the OR, I am.

470
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,042
Why so glum
on this bright spring day?

471
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:33,642
I've got a lot on my mind.

472
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:35,109
Would that be
the trauma fellowship

473
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,176
I hear you've applied for?

474
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,309
Might be.

475
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,409
Oh, I'll have
to invite myself

476
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,542
to sit on the selection
committee.

477
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:42,542
Anspaugh says you've got
a fighting chance.

478
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:46,742
Well, I did have
before Peter decided to apply.

479
00:18:46,776 --> 00:18:49,176
Peter's applied
for the trauma fellowship?

480
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:52,242
Yeah. Haven't you heard?

481
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:55,076
No. I must be out of the loop.

482
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,442
Well, I'm sure he was
planning on telling you.

483
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,109
Yes, I'm sure it was
just an oversight.

484
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:01,109
'Oh.'

485
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:03,009
I am so sorry for the wait.

486
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,576
Someone will be in soon.

487
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,742
The sun is shining,
the birds are singing

488
00:19:07,776 --> 00:19:10,109
and after that Vicodin,
I'm feeling no pain.

489
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:13,076
Wait.

490
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,376
Why don't you do my,
what did you call it?

491
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:17,109
Uh, subungual hematoma.

492
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,509
I see you're
a physician assistant.

493
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,176
Well, I'm working triage today.

494
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,342
You said it's
a very simple procedure.

495
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,776
To tell you the truth, I'm not
doing procedures anymore.

496
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:28,542
Anymore?

497
00:19:28,576 --> 00:19:30,542
I have Hepatitis C,
Reverend Lynn

498
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,376
and I don't want to
risk infecting you.

499
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:35,509
How could you infect me?

500
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,576
Well, if I cut myself‐‐

501
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,309
Cut yourself?

502
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:39,542
On what?

503
00:19:39,576 --> 00:19:41,509
I thought
you just needed to drain

504
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,009
the blood blister.

505
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,476
That's true.

506
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,342
So, if you're careful,
it shouldn't be any problem.

507
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,009
Right.

508
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:55,142
You remember,
I don't believe in accidents.

509
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:55,942
Hmm?

510
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:59,042
What happened
to your kid, Carter?

511
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:00,076
You think the blood
freaked him out?

512
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:01,342
Maybe the cop freaked him out.

513
00:20:01,376 --> 00:20:02,709
What was he
locked up for, anyway?

514
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:05,109
Listen, Antoine is not
a juvenile offender.

515
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,176
He attends the Southside
Math‐Science High School

516
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,142
and he's here for
an independent study project.

517
00:20:09,176 --> 00:20:12,042
‐ Oh.
‐ Hmm.

518
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,776
Hi, I'm Lucy Knight

519
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,476
and this must be Seth.

520
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,142
Hey, Seth, how
you doing in there?

521
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,576
I've only had
him a few weeks.

522
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,209
He got kicked out
of a group home.

523
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,442
I thought I'd
take him on.

524
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:24,209
I've handled
some tough ones.

525
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:26,342
‐ 'And why was he kicked out?'
‐ 'He's too much of a handful.'

526
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,376
He's been shuttled from foster
home to foster home

527
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:30,209
for the past three years.

528
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:31,509
How are you feeling, Seth?

529
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,709
I'm sorry about him
kicking that nurse.

530
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:35,776
I gave him some Inderal.

531
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,042
He shouldn't try to attack you.

532
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,576
'Oh, he's on Inderal?'

533
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,442
'Yeah, they just put him on
it. That's the latest.'

534
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:42,109
And what other medications
is he on?

535
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:44,476
Well, this is what they gave
me at the group home.

536
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,109
Tegretol to control
his impulsiveness

537
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:50,142
uh, Ritalin and clonidine

538
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:51,542
'for attention deficit.'

539
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:53,776
'And Mellaril at bedtime
to calm him down.'

540
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,142
Sounds like he's being
overmedicated.

541
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,009
Hey, Seth,
do you want a cookie?

542
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:06,042
So, how are things going?

543
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,409
Okay.

544
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,676
Do you ever get dizzy sometimes?

545
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:13,142
Sometimes I do get
a buzzy feeling in my head.

546
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:15,442
‐ Do you find that he's clumsy?
‐ He can be.

547
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:16,709
That's what happened here.

548
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,409
He fell against a window
and put his hand

549
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,009
'through trying to break
the fall.'

550
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,642
'This wasn't
from an outburst.'

551
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:35,442
I've been looking for you.

552
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,642
You took off right in the middle
of all the action.

553
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,309
Was it the recurrent
laryngeal nerve?

554
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,442
That Korean,
you said he had a nerve injury

555
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:44,509
that made him hoarse.
Was it the recurrent

556
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,142
laryngeal nerve
that got injured?

557
00:21:46,176 --> 00:21:47,542
Yeah, probably.

558
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,342
Supplies the vocal cord muscles.

559
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:53,409
That's right.

560
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,342
I like this book.

561
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:02,509
Frank Putnam, puncture
wound below the nipple.

562
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,309
Tripped and fell on a sprinkler
head while jogging.

563
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:07,209
BP is 95/65,
pulse 120.

564
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,542
Decreased breath sounds
on the left.

565
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:09,976
Hurts to take a breath.

566
00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:13,776
Prep for a chest tube,
32 french.

567
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,576
‐ Where's my wife?
‐ She's on her way.

568
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,076
Okay, everybody,
on my count.

569
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:20,376
‐ One, two, three. You okay?
‐ Yeah.

570
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:22,676
‐ I just pinched my finger.
‐ It's all her fault.

571
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,776
Betadine, number ten blade,
and one of versed.

572
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:29,009
‐ It's all who's fault?
‐ My wife.

573
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:30,342
Forcing me to exercise.

574
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,742
'I should have stayed
on the couch.'

575
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:33,409
Carol, chest tube tray.

576
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,142
'It's a beautiful day,
she says.'

577
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,042
'You should be
out of the house.'

578
00:22:37,076 --> 00:22:38,509
'That's the last time
I listen to her.'

579
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,376
'Okay, Mr. Putnam,
now just relax.'

580
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:42,176
‐ You should finish your rounds.
‐ Oh, come on.

581
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:43,509
I'll be admitting
this patient anyway.

582
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,009
What have we got?

583
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:47,742
Uh, chest impalement,
sixth intercostal space.

584
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:49,476
There could be injuries
below the diaphragm.

585
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,176
Set up the ultrasound.

586
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,109
Abdomen's soft
and non‐tender.

587
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:54,342
I think it's just
a chest injury.

588
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:56,676
Well, we can't be
too sure, Peter.

589
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,276
Okay, tube's in.

590
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:00,042
Hook up the thoraseal, Carol.

591
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:01,542
Where's carol?

592
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,609
Pressure's 110, there's
no way he got the spleen.

593
00:23:03,642 --> 00:23:05,176
Better safe than sorry.

594
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,042
200cc's out
of the chest tube.

595
00:23:07,076 --> 00:23:08,442
Alright, no free fluid
in the abdomen

596
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:09,776
What did I tell you?

597
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:12,076
Fine. Still could have
nicked the diaphragm.

598
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:13,609
Didn't I say there
was no possibility of that?

599
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,709
Excuse me, are we taking
this guy up to the OR?

600
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,576
Yeah, I wanna
give him a laparotomy.

601
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:19,042
‐ 'Check his diaphragm‐‐'
‐ I'd prefer laparoscopy.

602
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:20,376
It's less invasive.

603
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:22,209
Yeah, but you might miss
a hollow viscus injury.

604
00:23:22,242 --> 00:23:24,042
Okay, look, why don't
you guys take a moment

605
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,376
and figure out
what you want to do?

606
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:27,409
Mark, I need your help.

607
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,442
You okay?

608
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:35,376
I was cramping
and now I'm spotting.

609
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,642
Is it time
for your period?

610
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,642
No, Mark,
I'm pregnant.

611
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:49,342
Do you see a heartbeat?

612
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,742
Can't tell. It's hard
to get a good view.

613
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:57,242
Come on, Mark.

614
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:58,276
No.

615
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,409
'I don't see a heartbeat.'

616
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:01,109
'Oh, man.'

617
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,509
Carol, it's not necessarily
a blighted ovum.

618
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:08,442
It's probably just too early
to see with this.

619
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:11,242
I'll call radiology
and I'll set up an appointment

620
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:14,009
for a vaginal ultrasound,
alright?

621
00:24:18,476 --> 00:24:20,976
So you, uh, planning on
going through the pregnancy?

622
00:24:22,209 --> 00:24:25,042
I was hoping to, yeah.

623
00:24:25,076 --> 00:24:27,642
What does Doug think?

624
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,342
Uh...I figured I'd
wait on that one.

625
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:33,142
You know, get through
the first trimester.

626
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:36,342
I mean, if I miscarry,
there's not much to tell.

627
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,009
He'd probably want
to know either way.

628
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,676
Yeah, and I will, I'll
tell him at some point.

629
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:43,042
Just trying to get used
to this myself right now

630
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,209
and...things are
complicated enough.

631
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,342
Okay.

632
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,742
I'll call
for that appointment.

633
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:50,176
Thanks, Mark.

634
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:55,409
'And you say he's
been irritable?'

635
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:58,442
Off and on, kind of grouchy
from all the spitting up

636
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:00,142
and his stomach
hurting, probably.

637
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:02,509
Has he lost any weight?

638
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,042
I think so,
now that you say that.

639
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:05,476
His pants used to be snug.

640
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,776
‐ And now they're looser.
‐ Where do you live?

641
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,509
'Some apartments
on cottage grove.'

642
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,709
'Pretty old building?'

643
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,676
Yeah, I'd say so.

644
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:14,976
Roaches be having
family reunions.

645
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,676
Peeling paint?

646
00:25:20,709 --> 00:25:22,476
Peeling everything.

647
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:25,276
I bet Lonnie likes
to put things in his mouth.

648
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:26,576
Yeah, he do.

649
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,076
Has he been screened for lead?

650
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:30,209
Lead? No.

651
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,709
What's wrong with him, doctor?

652
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:34,409
Well, We're gonna
run some more tests.

653
00:25:34,442 --> 00:25:35,709
Try and get a better sense
of what's wrong.

654
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,642
So let's get a CBC.
And a lead level.

655
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,242
Right.

656
00:25:41,276 --> 00:25:43,009
I wanna try and find out
if Lonnie's symptoms

657
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,576
are a result of lead poisoning.

658
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,676
'Maybe from eating flakes
of paint, which kids do.'

659
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:49,542
But the, uh,
lead level results

660
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:51,242
won't be back for a couple
of days but there are things

661
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:52,542
we can learn from
the blood work.

662
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:54,742
Okay, whatever.
Just, make him better.

663
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:55,776
Mm‐hmm.

664
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:57,676
Ease up. Down.

665
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,076
'Dissect and mobilize
the internal mammary.'

666
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,276
‐ Got it.
‐ 'Excellent, Peter.'

667
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:08,342
'You definitely have
the dexterity'

668
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:10,576
'for cardiothoracic,
no doubt about it.'

669
00:26:10,609 --> 00:26:12,676
This is amazing.

670
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,742
It's like operating
a marionette.

671
00:26:14,776 --> 00:26:16,576
'The cutting edge
of cardiac bypass surgery.'

672
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,676
‐ 'Didn't I tell you?'
‐ 'You told me.'

673
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,642
Alright, let's keep flooding
the field with CO2.

674
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:23,109
We'll spoon up
the coronary artery

675
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:25,409
and lift it off
the anterior wall

676
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:27,442
and then we'll anastomose
the internal mammary

677
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,509
to the anterior descending
branch of the left coronary

678
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,609
make an end run
around the diseased artery.

679
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:33,309
You're familiar with
the concept of an "end run"

680
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,009
aren't you, Dr. Benton?

681
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:36,176
Of course I am.

682
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,409
Yes, I know that you are.

683
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,742
High levels
of lead can cause

684
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:45,609
basophilic stippling
in the blood cells.

685
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:49,609
And there it is.

686
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:52,176
‐ See this?
‐ Yep.

687
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,476
And the red cells
are hypochromic

688
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:57,309
or less red
than normal red cells

689
00:26:57,342 --> 00:27:00,076
which is a sign
of anemia.

690
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:03,142
Anemia, low iron
in the hemoglobin.

691
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:05,209
That's right.

692
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:06,676
Red blood cells need iron

693
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,242
so they can deliver oxygen
to the tissues.

694
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,276
Right.

695
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:12,376
Kids who are
anemic lack iron

696
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:14,176
which makes it very easy
for the lead

697
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:16,242
to bind to the red
blood cells.

698
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:18,309
So you can see how this
puts kids like Lonnie

699
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:20,342
in a doubly bad position.

700
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,009
How?

701
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,576
Well, poor children are
more likely to be anemic

702
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,276
'because of inadequate diet'

703
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:28,242
'and poor kids are more likely'

704
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:30,076
'to be exposed to lead paint..'

705
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,309
Because of living
in older buildings

706
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:32,342
instead of newer ones.

707
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,142
Yes.

708
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:35,309
So this kid's
got lead poisoning?

709
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:36,509
Mm‐hmm.

710
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,176
Looks like
a pretty severe case.

711
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:40,409
Dr. Romano, are you upset
about something?

712
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:42,442
Why would I be upset?

713
00:27:42,476 --> 00:27:45,709
I've been talking you up for
the cardiothoracic fellowship

714
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:48,176
to anybody who'll
listen to me.

715
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,276
and today I find out

716
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,709
you've thrown your hat
in the ring

717
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:52,142
for the ER trauma fellowship.

718
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:54,109
It's a bit confusing.

719
00:27:54,142 --> 00:27:55,476
Well, I wasn't taking

720
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,309
the cardiothoracic fellowship
for granted.

721
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,776
Hmm. So the trauma fellowship
is just a fallback. I see.

722
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,042
And if you were selected
for both, you would choose?

723
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,176
Cardiothoracic.

724
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:14,442
Any indecision you're feeling
about your future, Dr. Benton

725
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,542
'I can help, just say
the word and I will take'

726
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:20,709
the cardiothoracic fellowship
off the table.

727
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,609
No. It's my first choice.

728
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,176
Just be clear, Peter.

729
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,276
'For your own sake..'

730
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,276
...and mine.

731
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,276
Carol,
radiology called.

732
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:42,109
They can see you at 5 'O Clock
for the ultrasound.

733
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:43,242
Great. Thanks.

734
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:45,176
Listen, why don't we
get out of here

735
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:47,442
take a walk,
grab a movie?

736
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,642
I thought you had to go
to a trauma conference.

737
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:52,009
Uh, who wants to
hang out in a room

738
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:53,242
with a bunch of doctors?

739
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:55,109
Go to the conference.
I'm fine.

740
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:56,576
I know. I just thought‐‐

741
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,442
Actually, I could use this time
by myself right now.

742
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,142
Alright.

743
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:02,976
But I'm around
if you need to talk.

744
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,709
I know.

745
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,676
Oh, I told Kerry that
you weren't feeling well

746
00:29:06,709 --> 00:29:09,542
so if you have
to take off early.

747
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:10,576
Thanks, Mark.

748
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:18,409
Nurse Hathaway?

749
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:20,509
Coco, what are you doing
back here? Are you alright?

750
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,609
If I didn't do
something right with the baby

751
00:29:22,642 --> 00:29:23,976
would you have to tell on me?

752
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:34,376
How you doing, Seth?

753
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:35,542
Got any more cookies?

754
00:29:35,576 --> 00:29:37,176
Sure, I do.

755
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,676
I was talking to
your foster mom.

756
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:41,509
She seems like a
pretty nice lady.

757
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:43,076
What do you think?

758
00:29:43,109 --> 00:29:44,709
She's new.

759
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,176
She said your natural mom
died a few years ago.

760
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,409
I never knew my dad.

761
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,709
It's hard to grow up
without a parent.

762
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:59,176
She died in a car crash.
It was my dad's fault.

763
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,509
That's an awful thing to happen.

764
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:05,676
Do you think about it a lot?

765
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:07,576
No.

766
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,742
Does it make you mad sometimes?

767
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,542
Got any more cookies?

768
00:30:14,576 --> 00:30:16,642
That was my last one.

769
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,076
If you don't wanna talk about
your mom and dad

770
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,276
we don't have to.

771
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,409
Why do you want to?

772
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:24,076
I like talking to you.

773
00:30:24,109 --> 00:30:25,609
I wanna know
what's on your mind.

774
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:30,209
My dad gets drunk a lot.

775
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,709
That's why you have stay with
foster parents sometimes, huh?

776
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,676
He's an alcoholic.

777
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,776
A lot of people
have that problem.

778
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:43,576
Makes it kind of tough
on you, though.

779
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:47,176
I only wish that my dad would
come and see me sometime.

780
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,142
'Taxi.'

781
00:30:53,176 --> 00:30:55,142
Taxi!

782
00:30:55,176 --> 00:30:57,309
‐ Come on!
‐ 'Taxi!'

783
00:30:57,342 --> 00:31:00,476
Hey...taxi.

784
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:03,742
Tax..

785
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:08,342
Hey, hey! Thank you...
very much!

786
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,709
'Elizabeth?'

787
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:13,742
You alright?

788
00:31:13,776 --> 00:31:17,709
I cannot get a cab
in this bloody city.

789
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,742
Listen, uh...
you could take the el.

790
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,476
It goes right near the hotel.

791
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:25,109
‐ You sure?
‐ Yeah, yeah.

792
00:31:25,142 --> 00:31:27,076
I just, I wasn't sure
about the bath.

793
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:29,142
Nobody showed me.
I didn't know what to do.

794
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:33,342
Yes, you did. You knew to come
back and ask for help.

795
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,209
I was afraid to look stupid.

796
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:36,776
Well, you did the right thing.

797
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:39,109
Hi.

798
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:42,009
Just support him with
your hand, like that..

799
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:45,676
...and then just gently
wash him with a mild..

800
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:48,076
...soap. Yes.

801
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,509
You're good at this.
You must do it a lot.

802
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,309
No, not really.

803
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,042
You'll get good at it, too.

804
00:31:54,076 --> 00:31:55,409
Here. Why don't
you give it a try?

805
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:00,309
Yes.

806
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:10,742
Oh, Hey, Dr. Carter.
Did you need me?

807
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:12,142
Yeah. Come on in.

808
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:14,076
Crackin' the whip on you, 'twan.

809
00:32:14,109 --> 00:32:16,276
‐ Alright.
‐ Then we out.

810
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,009
Those friends of
yours from school?

811
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,076
Friends from the neighborhood.

812
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,242
You know, you don't have
to worry about the tie.

813
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:23,442
It's not necessary.

814
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:26,376
Oh, my mom said to wear it.

815
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:28,509
Have you ever had a
job before, Antoine?

816
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,709
No.

817
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,576
I realize that this isn't a job

818
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:34,076
but there's some things I feel
like I ought to tell you not..

819
00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:36,576
...not to give you
a hard time, but..

820
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:38,342
...you're a bright person
these are things

821
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,376
you're going to have to learn
anyway. It might as well be now.

822
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:42,209
‐ Alright.
‐ Alright.

823
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:45,042
With any job that you
have in the future..

824
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:47,009
things are gonna
be expected of you

825
00:32:47,042 --> 00:32:48,442
and that means you can't go
hangin' out with your buddies.

826
00:32:48,476 --> 00:32:50,176
Oh, but I had a reason
for doing that, doc.

827
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:51,409
I don't wanna hear any reasons.

828
00:32:51,442 --> 00:32:53,242
I'm not givin' you a hard time.

829
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,776
Just lettin' you know
what I expect of you, alright?

830
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,276
‐ Yes, sir.
‐ Alright.

831
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,142
‐ 'What's next?'
‐ Specificity.

832
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:02,676
No, uh, I got sensitivity.
It's a little crumpled.

833
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:04,076
I'll take it.

834
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,276
Methodologies?

835
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:06,476
No.

836
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:08,242
False negative rates?

837
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:10,442
Bingo.

838
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:12,376
Okay...outcomes?

839
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:16,176
Uh, it's got a footprint on it.
Looks kind of interesting.

840
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:19,276
Uh, it's, not very sexy.
It's just matter analysis.

841
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,442
Thought it might help me
bag the trauma fellowship.

842
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:23,376
Yeah, can't hurt.

843
00:33:23,409 --> 00:33:26,109
It'd be better
if I had it published.

844
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:28,709
Look, I'm really sorry
about that chest wound today.

845
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:31,109
Why are you sorry?
You did a great job.

846
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,742
Yeah. The trauma room shouldn't
be a battleground for surgeons.

847
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:37,142
‐ Oh, you mean Peter.
‐ 'Yep.'

848
00:33:37,176 --> 00:33:38,642
Well, that must be tough.

849
00:33:38,676 --> 00:33:41,409
‐ 'What?'
‐ Competing with your boyfriend.

850
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,676
Not boyfriend. Just competing.

851
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,476
‐ I thought you two were..
‐ History.

852
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:49,242
I gotta get better sources.

853
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,109
This is us.

854
00:33:57,542 --> 00:33:59,109
You think they'll
still let me speak?

855
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:01,142
Ten minutes, that's nothin'.

856
00:34:01,176 --> 00:34:03,109
Yeah, I'm supposed
to go first.

857
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:06,109
Yeah, well, you were busy
saving someone in the ER.

858
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,509
Four hours ago?

859
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:08,676
Work with me here.

860
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:15,676
So why aren't we stopping?

861
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:17,376
I guess it doesn't
stop here on weekends.

862
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,176
Don't worry, we can get off
at the next stop.

863
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:28,209
‐ Does that feel better?
‐ Much.

864
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:30,776
You should be
taking care of people.

865
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:34,576
Not working up front checking
pulses and doing paperwork.

866
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:35,776
Hey, Jeanie, I'm sorry
it took so long.

867
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,276
I got held up in the OR.

868
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,476
Hey, Reverend Lynn,
how're you doing?

869
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,076
I can't complain.

870
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:42,276
Miss Boulet has been
taking good care of me.

871
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:43,742
You two know each other?

872
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:47,609
Since Peter was a little boy
with straight A's.

873
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:49,542
I haven't seen you
around lately.

874
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,676
Yeah, well, you know,
I've been pretty busy here

875
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,276
and taking care of Reese.

876
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,409
My mother used to attend
Reverend Lynn's church.

877
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:59,009
Are you the Jeanie
that worked with Mrs. Benton?

878
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:02,276
‐ I am.
‐ She spoke of you.

879
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:06,742
Just before she passed,
she told me you were her angel.

880
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:09,109
That you brought her comfort.

881
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,476
Yeah.

882
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:13,776
I'll never forget
how much you meant to my mother.

883
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,242
You see?

884
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:16,409
I told you we didn't meet
by accident.

885
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:21,609
So Dr. Benton and I
are both in your debt.

886
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:25,342
I'd like to offer
some healing prayers.

887
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:29,042
I need all the help I can get.

888
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,342
You mean right now?

889
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:32,476
While the spirit is moving.

890
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:03,976
Amen.

891
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:11,976
That wasn't so bad.

892
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:14,376
No.

893
00:36:31,642 --> 00:36:33,509
Uh...conference room C.

894
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:39,376
‐ Which way?
‐ I don't know.

895
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,709
But you've been here before?

896
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,109
Yeah, but I don't know
the rooms.

897
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,276
Uh, conference rooms, right.

898
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:45,742
'...but I'm serious.'

899
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:47,176
'I'm gonna marry this girl.'

900
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,776
‐ Sorry.
‐ Let's get out of here.

901
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,709
Excuse me, could you tell us
where the trauma

902
00:36:55,742 --> 00:36:57,609
physicians conference is?

903
00:36:57,642 --> 00:36:59,709
‐ Did you check the directory?
‐ Uh, yeah, conference room C.

904
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,776
But there's
a wedding in there.

905
00:37:01,809 --> 00:37:04,376
That's ballroom C. Conference
room C is on the lower level.

906
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:06,142
‐ Of course.
‐ Where's the elevator?

907
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,342
Through the bar.

908
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:09,076
‐ Makes sense.
‐ Thank you.

909
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,442
‐ Want a drink?
‐ Sure. We got time.

910
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:12,342
Oh, look, a giant pig
ice sculpture.

911
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:18,576
Oh! Sorry.

912
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:21,409
She's had a little
too much to drink.

913
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:31,276
So, are you here
for the conference?

914
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:34,286
This is taking too long.

915
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:36,219
‐ Yeah, let's take the stairs.
‐ Oh, good idea.

916
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:37,853
'You're terrible.'

917
00:37:37,886 --> 00:37:40,253
Me? You're the one who
ran into them. Hurry up.

918
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,653
I'm in heels.

919
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:43,153
Yeah, well, take
them off, woman.

920
00:37:43,186 --> 00:37:45,986
‐ Woman? Did you call me woman?
‐ Who, me?

921
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,686
Yeah, I'll let it slide seeing
as you rushed to my rescue.

922
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,119
Yeah, well,
I haven't saved you yet.

923
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:51,686
Well, at least we can
make an appearance.

924
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,019
It's a dead end.

925
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:05,886
Uh‐oh.

926
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,119
Ha ha ha, very funny.

927
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:09,619
No, really, it's locked.

928
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,619
You've got to be kidding me.

929
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:15,286
I think somebody didn't want us
to make this conference.

930
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,853
‐ 'Dr. Carter?'
‐ Mm‐hmm?

931
00:38:17,886 --> 00:38:20,586
Um, could I see you over
here for a minute, please?

932
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:27,719
This is Sharice Haines
and this is her son Andre.

933
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:29,819
I think he might have
lead poisoning.

934
00:38:29,853 --> 00:38:31,819
‐ Could you take a look?
‐ Sure.

935
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,686
‐ How you doing?
‐ Hi.

936
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:36,253
He's been feelin' sick.
I don't know why.

937
00:38:36,286 --> 00:38:40,886
I sent some of my friends to go
bring Andre and his mother in.

938
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,086
Yeah, I can examine
him right now.

939
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,319
And do those blood tests, right?

940
00:38:43,353 --> 00:38:44,986
Well, if that's
what's called for.

941
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,053
First thing is to take a history
and do a physical exam.

942
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:49,786
May I see your son?

943
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:51,953
Let me ask you a few questions.

944
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:53,619
Dr. Carter..

945
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:55,019
...I know it's past 4 o'clock..

946
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:57,986
...but can I hang around
and see how this goes?

947
00:38:58,019 --> 00:38:59,719
Absolutely.

948
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,653
Thank you.

949
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,353
Does it hurt when
I do that, Andre?

950
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:05,319
'When I press in here?'

951
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:07,119
Seth is being
drastically overmedicated.

952
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:08,919
He's been sent from foster home
to foster home.

953
00:39:08,953 --> 00:39:10,186
Each time, he gets
put on a new med

954
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,953
without regard to the old ones.

955
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,653
Looks like you found out
just in time.

956
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:15,019
Well, the credit really
goes to my student.

957
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,719
Lucy talked to the boy
and the foster mom.

958
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:17,953
Found the problem right away.

959
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:19,286
Good for you, Miss Knight.

960
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,053
So now we can put Seth
on the proper medication.

961
00:39:21,086 --> 00:39:22,953
Actually, Dr. Deraad,
I think he could benefit

962
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,119
from psychotherapy as well.

963
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,686
All Seth really needs is

964
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,019
for someone to listen
to him and to care.

965
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:29,353
I'm glad to hear you say that.

966
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:31,253
Most students think it's
just about pushin' meds.

967
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:33,353
They don't wanna take
the time to do therapy.

968
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:35,019
A lot of residents
are like that, too.

969
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,219
Isn't that right, Dr. Myers?

970
00:39:36,253 --> 00:39:38,053
'I suppose so.'

971
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:39,886
You might just learn somethin'
from your student on this point.

972
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,719
'I was wonderin' if I could
continue counseling this kid.'

973
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:44,253
Well, your psych rotation's
almost over.

974
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:46,853
And then I start
my second ER rotation

975
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,819
but I'd still like to
see Seth if I could.

976
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:50,619
I'll supervise you myself.

977
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:53,786
I think this would be a
great case for you, Miss Knight.

978
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:57,986
Well?

979
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,286
I don't understand.

980
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:00,686
You know, we can
look into transplants.

981
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,886
Talk to some experts.

982
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,986
‐ They're fine.
‐ What?

983
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:06,786
My liver function tests
are almost normal.

984
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:08,953
I guess the medication
must be working.

985
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:10,586
Yeah, I'll say.

986
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,286
Maybe I stressed myself out.
Made myself sick.

987
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,119
Yeah. Uh

988
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:19,253
I guess you can't underestimate
the power of prayer, huh?

989
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:28,153
Okay, we need you to take
everything off, put on the gown

990
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:30,686
and the radiologist will be in,
in just a minute, okay?

991
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,886
We have a struggling
national health service.

992
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,586
You have to wait ages
for non‐emergencies

993
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:45,786
but I believe in it.

994
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,153
No, I meant for the surgeons.

995
00:40:47,186 --> 00:40:49,719
I mean, you seem
so desperate to stay.

996
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:51,153
Am I that transparent?

997
00:40:51,186 --> 00:40:53,153
Well, not desperate.

998
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:55,053
Well, I like it here.
It suits me.

999
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,553
You don't get homesick?

1000
00:40:57,219 --> 00:40:58,819
Well, a little.

1001
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:04,153
I do get lonely sometimes.

1002
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:07,253
I complain about work, but it's
my most loyal companion, really.

1003
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:13,919
It's hard to get used to it,
you know, being alone.

1004
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:17,919
But, uh..I, uh..

1005
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:20,719
...after a while, you expect it.

1006
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:23,719
And then you start
to appreciate it.

1007
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,919
‐ You really believe that?
‐ I'm full of crap.

1008
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,619
You two locked in?

1009
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:31,953
‐ Yes. Oh.
‐ Yes!

1010
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:48,786
Still want that drink.

1011
00:41:48,819 --> 00:41:49,953
You got it.

1012
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:02,919
Well, I see you haven't
learned your lesson.

1013
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,019
It's a character flaw.

1014
00:42:05,053 --> 00:42:08,586
I'm a stubborn old mule.

1015
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,753
I hear you.

1016
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:13,853
So, you're here.

1017
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:15,019
It's a start.

1018
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:19,786
Is there a heartbeat?

1019
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:23,353
You said you've had
some cramping?

1020
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,819
A little, and earlier today,
some spotting.

1021
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:38,919
There we go.

1022
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,286
Right there.
Strong steady heartbeat.

1023
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:45,786
‐ Are you sure?
‐ No doubt about it.

1024
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:50,019
Thank god.

1025
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:51,719
Not a 100 percent guarantee

1026
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:54,886
'that everything'll be okay
but it's a good sign.'

1027
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,586
'The bubonic plague?'

1028
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,253
'I was nine years old.'

1029
00:43:01,286 --> 00:43:03,686
The counselor told us
not to feed the squirrels

1030
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,686
'cause we might catch
bubonic plague.

1031
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,986
Could you?

1032
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,886
I don't know,
but Timmy fed the squirrels.

1033
00:43:10,253 --> 00:43:12,253
So Jimmy had to be
locked in the cabin.

1034
00:43:12,286 --> 00:43:14,619
Timmy, not Jimmy.

1035
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:15,986
I said, Timmy.

1036
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:18,819
Sounded like, Jimmy.

1037
00:43:20,053 --> 00:43:23,353
Oh, listen.

1038
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:26,686
‐ What?
‐ It's weird.

1039
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,319
‐ What's weird?
‐ They're playing a tango.

1040
00:43:32,353 --> 00:43:37,253
‐ You know the tango?
‐ Wanna crash a wedding?

1041
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:41,686
You do know how to do this?

1042
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,119
It's a traditional
American wedding dance.

1043
