1
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:06,266
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,400
‐ Well, that must be tough.
‐ What?

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,600
Competing with your boyfriend.

4
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:11,400
Not boyfriend, just competing.

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,533
Any indecision you're feeling
about your future

6
00:00:13,566 --> 00:00:14,733
Dr. Benton, I can help.

7
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,333
Just say the word
and I will take

8
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:19,033
the cardiothoracic fellowship
off the table.

9
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,266
By all means, feel free to apply
for the trauma fellowship.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,733
You're a little closed
off for my tastes.

11
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,366
‐ Closed off?
‐ Emotionally withdrawn.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,233
Roxanne called. Twice.

13
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:29,666
‐ So..
‐ So..

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,233
So what?

15
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:32,433
You plannin' on going
through with the pregnancy?

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,633
I was hoping to.

17
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,066
What does Doug think?

18
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,633
I mean, do we even pretend to be
living in a democracy anymore?

19
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,466
You know, it's just
a medieval power play

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,666
between career
republicans and democrats

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,500
and who hates who more.

22
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:54,533
If there were still guillotines
and burning at the stake

23
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:56,233
I swear, they'd be
doing that to each other.

24
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,733
Uh‐huh.

25
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,266
Hey, this is where I do
two reps of ten.

26
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,466
You wanna go first?

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,133
‐ Go ahead.
‐ Okay.

28
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:05,366
I didn't know anybody
actually stopped at these.

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,566
Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,133
End of your first trimester

31
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,633
you get this sudden
burst of energy.

32
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:13,233
Just have to keep
my heart rate under 140.

33
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:15,233
So, did you read it?

34
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:17,733
Yeah.

35
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:20,066
What'd you think?

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,133
That it's a good letter.

37
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,366
You're very clear about what you
want and don't want from him.

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Yeah, I had to write it
all out, you know? Whoo!

39
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:29,800
But you're gonna talk to him.

40
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,466
Oh, sure. Sure.

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,566
I just, uh, you know..

42
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,133
...after he reads it.

43
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,133
I know Doug's gonna
go on his gut reaction

44
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,066
and I don't want him
coming running back here.

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,233
You don't?

46
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,433
When are you gonna
send the letter?

47
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,633
I'm gonna fax it. I got his fax
number a couple of days ago.

48
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:55,266
What do you think he'll do?

49
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
Honestly..

50
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:58,733
...he'll be on the first plane.

51
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,633
'Oh, Lucy, Lucy, oh.
I'm late. I'm sorry.'

52
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,033
That's okay.

53
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,300
Thanks for meeting me.

54
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,700
I didn't mean to sound
so mysterious.

55
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,366
I didn't know what you drink.

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,433
Oh, no. Gave up caffeine for
lent. I didn't even miss it.

57
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,233
Look, let me get right to the
point. We're both busy people.

58
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,800
‐ Okay.
‐ It's about John.

59
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,266
‐ Carter?
‐ Yeah.

60
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,666
I've tried to bring
this up with him

61
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,400
and I got nowhere fast,
so let me have a run at you.

62
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,733
If you two are involved

63
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,333
you know, harmless
workplace flirtation

64
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,466
or out‐and‐out twice‐a‐day
sex in the lab.

65
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,366
Whatever, just,
someone needs to let me know

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
and I'll fold up my tent
and get out of the way.

67
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,333
Uh, there's nothing going on
between me and Carter.

68
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,500
Okay, maybe at one point I
thought there might be, but no.

69
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,633
I mean, we haven't really
spoken to each other

70
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,300
in the last few months.

71
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,700
Well..

72
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,233
...so much for that theory.

73
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,166
Honestly, Roxanne,
he works so hard

74
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,266
I doubt he has time
to cheat on you.

75
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,133
You mean our relationship
has just stalled out on its own?

76
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,333
I don't know about that.

77
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:59,400
Well, it has. I mean, it has.

78
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:00,733
We have been at the
lotta laughs phase

79
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,233
for two months too long.

80
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,033
I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:08,300
You were my last resort for
an obstacle I could tackle.

82
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,500
I wish I had better
news for you.

83
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,700
You know, I don't envy you.

84
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,233
He's one mixed up guy.

85
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,733
Mmm.

86
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,133
He is.

87
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,700
Sweet...but mixed up.

88
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,400
A deadly combination.

89
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,033
Mm‐hmm.

90
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,633
'I think about your
breasts all day.'

91
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,066
They think about you.

92
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,366
'I'll come to
work with you.'

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,100
'Do. I want you to.'

94
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,433
Oh, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:44,033
'Oh, here we go again.'

96
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,666
I lost power twice last night.

97
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,300
We didn't.

98
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,566
'It's the weather.'

99
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,766
It's the humidity.

100
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,333
It's arcing at the substation.

101
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,166
Can't be late.

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,333
‐ I love you.
‐ I love you.

103
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,500
It's spring.

104
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,766
No, really, I, um, admire you.

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,333
I like emergency medicine.

106
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:06,533
Still, it takes guts.

107
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:07,733
What takes guts?

108
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,533
For Lucy to do another
ER Rotation.

109
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,066
It takes guts
to tackle something

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,566
that got the better of you
the first time around.

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,300
Glad you feel that way,
because you're gonna get

112
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,733
a second chance
to supervise her.

113
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,600
Carter, what am I supposed
to do with this?

114
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,200
Uh...I called UPS for a pickup.

115
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,666
If they're not here by this
afternoon, let me know?

116
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,500
‐ The oriental?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

117
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,233
Gotta be in Bangkok by Sunday.

118
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,266
Good boy, Carter. Mother's day.

119
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,700
Oh, no.

120
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,033
‐ Is that this week?
‐ You forgot your mothers?

121
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,333
Ah, I better call
the bowling alley.

122
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,800
That's what she likes.

123
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,700
So what are your kids doing
for you or is it a surprise?

124
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,333
Oh, big surprise every year.

125
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:40,133
Runny eggs
and burnt toast in bed

126
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,600
two hours before
I wanna wake up.

127
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,233
I can't wait.

128
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:46,600
I never let mother know
what's in store.

129
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:49,600
Last year it was a helicopter
ride and a concert in grant park

130
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:51,666
and this year, I've hired a limo

131
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,200
and I'm gonna take
her to all the places

132
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,533
she liked to take me as a kid.

133
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,466
The zoo, the Adler,
this little tea room

134
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,200
back in our old neighborhood.

135
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,433
What?

136
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,033
Didn't think I had
a mother, did you?

137
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,066
Just trying to picture her.

138
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,666
‐ So, what do we got here today?
‐ We?

139
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,500
Yeah, didn't Kerry tell you?
I'm spending the day down here.

140
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,466
Kerry just asked
for the day off.

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,100
Well, as acting chief poo‐bah

142
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,366
I decided I wanna get
a better understanding

143
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
of what the hell
goes on down here.

144
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,600
Okay, you wanna start with
oozing pustules

145
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,333
or projectile vomiting?

146
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,566
I don't wanna see patients.
I just want to watch and marvel.

147
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,733
After you.

148
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,466
So, together again?

149
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,166
Hey, bet you were about to call.

150
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,366
We got a late start
this morning.

151
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,566
Oh, hey, Reese.

152
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Is Carla's van
in the shop again?

153
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,733
Uh, no. She just had
a big day today.

154
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,666
You know what. Next time she
gets stuck, tell her to call.

155
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,633
Ah, man, we weren't stuck.

156
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,166
I love being with Reese.

157
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,066
Alright. Let's get him in here.

158
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,800
So, I'll pick him up
at three, right?

159
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,300
No, I'll bring him home
after his speech therapy.

160
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,600
Oh, he's still in that?

161
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,033
I thought you were
going the signing route.

162
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm not going any route. I'm
doing what's best for my son.

163
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,400
You're right. Be good, son.

164
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,100
Next?

165
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,800
76‐year‐old male
came in hypotensive

166
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,200
febrile with purulent sputum.

167
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,400
Septic.

168
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,666
Yeah, we had to tube him.

169
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
Brought his pressure up
with dopamine

170
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,333
and gave him
some cefotaxime.

171
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,533
So what's he doing here?

172
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,800
Why don't you get him
up the ICU?

173
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,600
We're waiting for
beds upstairs, aren't we?

174
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,466
Carol, can you tell
us what you have?

175
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,033
74 year old woman took a spill.

176
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,600
Temp's a little
elevated at 99.9.

177
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:30,766
Well, she fell out of her
wheelchair down the back stoop.

178
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,466
I‐I‐I was ringing the doorbell
up front and I heard the bang

179
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,166
and my heart sank.

180
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,733
I mean, you see, I'm‐I'm
the Armstrong's ' neighbor.

181
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,666
I‐I‐Insisted on driving them in.

182
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,533
BP's 160/90.

183
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:45,333
Mr. Armstrong reports symptoms
of disorientation.

184
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:46,700
Alzheimer's.

185
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,600
But they...they don't wanna
call it that.

186
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,733
H‐he frets about
his health plan.

187
00:07:50,766 --> 00:07:52,533
Gladys doesn't have
her hearing aid in.

188
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,166
'I do the best I can
looking in on them.'

189
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,466
I mean, she's such a dear.

190
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Army's not much of a cook.

191
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,300
Okay! I get the picture!

192
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,466
'Have Carter or Lucy
take a look.'

193
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,600
'Are they done? Is she okay?'

194
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:08,466
And that is why I prefer
my patients anesthetized.

195
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,700
Hey, is, uh, she putting
on a little weight?

196
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,100
That nurse what's her name?

197
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,300
Carol Hathaway?

198
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,500
Is she porking out a little bit?

199
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,800
Hate to see that happen.

200
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,500
I've had some decent
fantasies about that one.

201
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:20,300
Okay, in exam four, we have a
36 year old with calf pain..

202
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,133
...recurrent DVT
On a heparin drip.

203
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,433
Ever dream about Lizzie Corday?

204
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,633
What?

205
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,033
It'd be understandable.

206
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,666
It'd be one motive
I could follow

207
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,333
for the ER trying to poach her
away from surgery.

208
00:08:33,366 --> 00:08:36,333
Uh, trauma fellowship is not
about poaching, Robert.

209
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,566
How long has it been, Mark?

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,766
Since you had a trauma
come in, I mean.

211
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,633
‐ What? Today?
‐ Yeah.

212
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,266
Five, six hours.
They usually‐‐

213
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay, so, if you actually
had a trauma fellow

214
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,766
for the last five or six hours

215
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,766
that highly skilled
surgical resident

216
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,466
would've been sitting on
her pretty little hands

217
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,800
or maybe baby sitting gorks,
waiting for ICU Beds.

218
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,766
Mark, we got a partial
scalping on the way in.

219
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,066
Woman fell down an
escalator at O'Hare.

220
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,366
Not a moment too soon.

221
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,633
Well, timing is everything.

222
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,366
‐ Pher catch. That I need!
‐ Go for it.

223
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,433
That one has no
perfume enhancement

224
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,400
just pure, synthetic pheromones

225
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,400
for those who wanna maximize
their biologic signals.

226
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:18,166
Ooh, I'd like to try this on Al.

227
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,666
No, if you're already in
a committed relationship.

228
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,800
Full pher is for you.

229
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,400
It has a sandalwood fragrance

230
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,200
but with a, with a
dopamine like boost.

231
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,600
Mmm, nice. And I'm not one
for perfumes.

232
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:31,266
This isn't perfume.

233
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,600
It's biochemical
awareness therapy.

234
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,800
They say pheromones
are responsible for

235
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:36,700
who you're attracted to

236
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,766
and why women friends
get their periods in sync.

237
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Exactly! Medical professionals
always understand.

238
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,700
Lookin' for me?

239
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:49,133
Oh, uh, this is uh,
Phyllis Farr and, um

240
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,666
she experienced some shortness
of breath this morning.

241
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:58,500
She has a history of a‐fib
and had an embolic CBA

242
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:01,600
two years ago, and she's now on
coumadin and dig.

243
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,766
One teeny, tiny little stroke

244
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,533
and I was smoking
like a chimney then.

245
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,766
Some men are inherently
less receptive.

246
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,166
Hmm?

247
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,500
Uh, I think it was just
anxiety this morning.

248
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,133
I had this mega meeting with
Marshall Field's. I'm sorry.

249
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,233
Ms. Farr is thinking
that she doesn't need to stay

250
00:10:19,266 --> 00:10:21,500
but I'd like her admitted
to telemetry.

251
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,366
Her dyspnea was relieved by
nitro and it could be angina.

252
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,333
Darling, I told you,
I'm entirely too young for that.

253
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:30,033
I don't think we need
to admit you quite yet.

254
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,633
'But we should get
you on an EKG.'

255
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,200
And monitor you here in the ER.

256
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,766
Also check a triponin
with a CPK.

257
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,033
You're saying to cancel
with Marshall Field's?

258
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:41,133
Oh, they want you all the more
when they know you're busy.

259
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,200
Carol..

260
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,400
...did you send it?

261
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,166
I am. Today.
I'm ravenous.

262
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
You know, it's true.
You really do get cravings.

263
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,400
Can you steal away
to the cafeteria?

264
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,133
Do you know if they have
a surf and turf?

265
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,500
'Cause that's what I feel like.

266
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:56,800
A big, buttery lobster
and a thick, raw steak.

267
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,766
Morton's, after
the shift, my treat.

268
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,500
No, I‐I want it now.

269
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:01,666
You have a patient for me?

270
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,133
Oh, yeah. Sweet old lady.

271
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,666
But watch out for the husband.
He's a grouch.

272
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,566
Do you know where the ruleout
thoracic aneurysm is?

273
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,233
Maggie's patient?

274
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,566
I don't know. Peter told me
to take the consult.

275
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,133
Oh, I think she died.
Check in sutures.

276
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,100
Thoracic aneurysm.
Is that the patient?

277
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,033
Uh, no, she's back from x‐ray.
Where do they want her?

278
00:11:21,066 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh, uh, sorry.
Check at the desk.

279
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,533
Lizzie.

280
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:24,766
Peter's already
been paged on this

281
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,266
but you'll probably
wanna see it.

282
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,466
It takes more than
a ten‐centimeter

283
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,366
scalp avulsion to
get my heart pumping

284
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,733
but hey, I'm not
a trauma wonk.

285
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,166
I had stuff in both hands

286
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,633
and somebody shoved me
from behind.

287
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,033
I hate escalators.

288
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:36,200
How about here?

289
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,766
'Yeah. That hurts.'

290
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,433
‐ Elizabeth, nice to see you.
‐ Scalp injury?

291
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,700
Uh, Ms. Price tried to get
to baggage claim head first.

292
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,200
Am I bleeding a lot?

293
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,700
Mm‐hmm. The scalp likes to gush.

294
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,700
Okay. Would you like
to help me tie it off?

295
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,100
Oh, I'd be delighted.

296
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:52,700
‐ Whoa!
‐ Okay.

297
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:54,433
Curved kelly. 3.0 vicryl.

298
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:56,200
Yeah, I need some suction.

299
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,366
They had our plane circling
for two hours

300
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,566
because of the wind.

301
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,033
It's about to storm.

302
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,600
There it is.

303
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,033
Now, can you get a clamp on it?

304
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,600
Mm‐hmm. With your help.

305
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:09,700
Okay...holding steady.

306
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,700
There you go.

307
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,666
That's it. Mm‐hmm.

308
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,466
Good. Got it.

309
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,800
Now...show me your tip.

310
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,300
You two want me to leave?

311
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,500
Oh, um, actually,
it's surgeon talk.

312
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,666
He elevates his clamp
so that I can slide my suture..

313
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,533
Hmm. Actually, that sounds
even worse, doesn't it?

314
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:31,766
You know what they say..

315
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,800
Uh‐oh. Power's out.

316
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,500
Okay, folks, in a few seconds

317
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:39,666
the auxiliary generator
will switch on.

318
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,200
Connie, who's charge nurse
for internal?

319
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,600
We have a power failure.

320
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,233
Make sure all vents
and infusion pumps

321
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,333
are plugged into
the red outlets.

322
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,633
'Okay, like I said..'

323
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,633
...false alarm,
power's been restored.

324
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,333
I never heard no backup
generator kick in.

325
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,333
It takes a few seconds
for them to switch over.

326
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,600
All of your family members
would've been taken care of.

327
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,533
You better hope.
My uncle's connected.

328
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,433
All the machines are
on a battery backup.

329
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,200
I wasn't talkin'
about machines.

330
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:04,666
Little excitement, huh?

331
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,433
Did Roxanne find you?
She wanted to have lunch.

332
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:07,633
It's a little busy today.

333
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,400
She was in chairs.

334
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,033
Carter, can you help me reboot
Ms. Farr's EKG Monitor?

335
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,366
The battery pack was low.

336
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,566
I think it shut off
when we lost power.

337
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,300
Yeah, I'll try.

338
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,066
'It's the perfect time.'

339
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,533
'But we haven't
gone public yet.'

340
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,533
All the more reason to act now.

341
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,400
'Look, some companies won't
consider clients'

342
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,433
with high‐risk profiles,
especially those

343
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,166
with pre‐existing
conditions.

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,033
‐ Roxanne?
‐ Oh, Dr. Carter.

345
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:31,800
I seem to be powerless.

346
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,166
Yes, I know. I'll take care
of that in a minute.

347
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
‐ Roxanne?
‐ Yeah. Bye.

348
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:40,500
I had a free hour and
I thought that maybe, um..

349
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,700
What are you doing in there?
You hawking my patient?

350
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,600
That woman might have
suffered an MI.

351
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,566
Oh, come on. Lydia said
her EKG was good.

352
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,200
Are you selling her insurance?

353
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:48,533
No, actually, it was
a counter‐move.

354
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:50,700
She was trying to sell me
a 100 shares

355
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,466
of pheromone enhancements, or..

356
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,566
Roxanne, it is unethical
to prey on people

357
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,800
while they're vulnerable.

358
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,466
Prey on people?

359
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,266
John, I...I sold insurance
before I met you.

360
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,500
I sold you insurance before
we even went on a date.

361
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,533
Why are you trying
to pick a fight?

362
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:06,133
I'm not trying
to pick a fight.

363
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,600
‐ Yeah, you are.
‐ Why would I pick a fight?

364
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:08,733
I don't know.

365
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:11,200
But maybe...maybe
you wanna break up

366
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,533
and it would be much easier
for you to do so

367
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,766
over some failure of mine.

368
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,133
Wrong.

369
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,566
If you wanna break up I‐I think
you should just say so.

370
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,300
Okay, I wanna break up.

371
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,800
And I think it is sleazy

372
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,766
to push insurance on people
when they're patients.

373
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,433
Who the hell left this patient
out here in the hall?

374
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,666
I saw an x‐ray tech.
Did he just leave her?

375
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,200
Well, there's no chart.

376
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,200
Oh, god.

377
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,400
What the hell happened?

378
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,666
She's not breathing.

379
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
Let's get her to trauma.

380
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,166
We need a hand here!

381
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,533
What's going on?

382
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,666
Female patient.
No ID. Respiratory arrest.

383
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,733
‐ I think she's been beaten.
‐ Intubation kit. Now.

384
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:57,766
'Put her on a monitor.'

385
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,066
We need some help in here.

386
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,233
'What is going on?'

387
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,266
Young woman found
in the hall.

388
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,700
May be asphyxiated.

389
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,266
Looks like she's
been beaten up.

390
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,166
And sexually assaulted.

391
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,033
I'm in. Bag her.

392
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:10,433
Okay, I need
post‐intubation film.

393
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:11,733
Is Peter still next door?

394
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,433
He took Miss Price
to radiology.

395
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:16,300
BP's 110/80.
Pulse ox is 97.

396
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,766
Order a head
and belly CT.

397
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,366
Feels like fractured ribs.
Where'd you find her?

398
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,633
She was outside exam four
on a gurney.

399
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,333
I'd seen her earlier. A tech
brought her down from x‐ray.

400
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,600
An x‐ray tech or
someone from transport?

401
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,200
I don't know.
I've never seem him before.

402
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,559
‐ From medicine?
‐ Sulla Andrews.

403
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,293
‐ I'm Mark Greene.
‐ When was she found?

404
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,326
‐ A couple of hours ago.
‐ When did you last see her?

405
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,159
10 O'clock this morning.
We've all been frantic.

406
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,359
It didn't make sense
that she disappeared.

407
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:49,059
‐ She was a patient here?
‐ On the medical ward.

408
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,493
No wonder the cops
are everywhere.

409
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:52,859
I sure hope Dr. Corday
got a good look at the bastard.

410
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:54,493
‐ Pretty scary.
‐ I know it.

411
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:56,093
You know, even I'm looking
over my shoulder.

412
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,426
Let's keep our voices down.

413
00:15:57,459 --> 00:15:59,159
The police agree that
we should alert all staff

414
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:00,493
to the possibility
of a tech or someone

415
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,159
who looks like a tech
and may be dangerous.

416
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,859
But let's try to avoid
a general panic.

417
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,259
You mean,
not tell the patients?

418
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,193
Ah, at this point,
it doesn't seem necessary.

419
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,893
The guy probably bolted.

420
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,293
Still, don't leave
any patients unattended

421
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,326
for any period of time

422
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,859
and don't relinquish patients

423
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:14,559
into the hands of anyone
who you don't recognize

424
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:16,493
or who doesn't
have proper hospital ID.

425
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:18,159
What if you're not sure?

426
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,059
There's a policeman
stationed in every hallway.

427
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,593
'Call them.'

428
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,593
Alright?

429
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,326
Oh. Oh, that smarts.

430
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,493
I know, Mrs. Armstrong.
We're trying to be gentle.

431
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:29,026
Did you change
these dressings?

432
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,259
No, I thought you might
want to x‐ray her first.

433
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,293
Are you okay?

434
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,459
Yeah, I just suddenly got tired.

435
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,459
Oh, great.
I need the right hip.

436
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:41,226
Oh, oh, did she break
anything, doctor?

437
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,226
That's what this x‐ray
will tell us.

438
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,959
I knew as soon as
I heard that bang.

439
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:47,459
I knew she'd fallen.

440
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,959
Uh, t‐this is a waste of time.

441
00:16:49,993 --> 00:16:52,026
You know, um, I think
it would probably be best

442
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,926
if we, uh, we could
just come over here

443
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:54,959
away from
the x‐ray, okay?

444
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:56,826
‐ Okay?
‐ Thanks.

445
00:16:56,859 --> 00:16:59,026
It won't‐won't matter.

446
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,159
Gladys, get‐get, get your car.

447
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,926
You know, uh, Mr. Armstrong,
have you had anything to eat?

448
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,093
You've been here for hours.

449
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,159
'Shooting.'

450
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,559
'I'm not hungry.'

451
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,993
Get the car.

452
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:11,326
'I'm not hungry.'

453
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,293
Army never eats.

454
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:15,459
Look at him.
Like a scarecrow.

455
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,926
I‐I'm taking her home.

456
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,426
N‐no one can help.

457
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:21,926
How's everything going in here?

458
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,359
Well, there
certainly are

459
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:25,259
plenty of doctors on hand.

460
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:27,393
Ha ha, I'm Dr. Carter.

461
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,959
No one can help.

462
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:31,326
Put her on IV Antibiotics?

463
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,459
Uh, Mrs. Armstrong
had a bleeding sacral decubitus

464
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,093
with surrounding cellulitis.

465
00:17:36,126 --> 00:17:38,159
‐ She has what?
‐ Bedsores.

466
00:17:38,193 --> 00:17:40,326
And, uh, she's in pain
after a fall.

467
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,993
I'm guessing
it's a fractured hip.

468
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:44,059
Her leg is internally rotated.

469
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,859
'I'm Gladys,
their neighbor.'

470
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,593
I brought her in.

471
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,226
Good work, Gladys.

472
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:53,426
Okay, everything looks
under control in here.

473
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:54,926
Do you, uh, need any help
with the husband?

474
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,026
He seems like a handful.

475
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:57,526
I was thinking
about calling psych.

476
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,359
He seems depressed.

477
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:00,526
See, the wife's your patient.

478
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,893
You might want
to stay focused.

479
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,459
But he's her
primary caregiver

480
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:05,359
and her situation is
not going to improve

481
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:06,893
unless he's able to help her.

482
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,193
Can you really think
he's going to talk to psych?

483
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:09,493
Maybe.

484
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:10,559
Give it a try.

485
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:14,193
Also...Carol needs a break.

486
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,393
Her name is Laurie Heller.

487
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:25,126
Ward nurse said her bed
was empty after rounds.

488
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,993
Yeah. She's talking
to the detective now.

489
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,893
Unfortunately, no one
up in medicine

490
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:35,326
saw anyone resembling
the man I saw.

491
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,226
She still hasn't
regained consciousness.

492
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,226
I don't think she will.

493
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,126
She's been admitted
since a traffic accident

494
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,026
ten days ago.

495
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,459
In a vegetative state.

496
00:18:45,493 --> 00:18:47,259
Oh, god.

497
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:51,293
Her family
has just been persuaded

498
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,193
to extubate her..

499
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,459
...and transfer her
to long‐term nursing care.

500
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,259
They've been hoping
for a miracle.

501
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,459
It's barbaric.

502
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:04,426
Here I am, the worst
eyewitness in history.

503
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,893
How I could hardly
tell them anything.

504
00:19:05,926 --> 00:19:07,826
I didn't pay attention
to the guy.

505
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,993
Well, I'm sure you helped.

506
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:13,059
Uh, average height...I think.

507
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:14,993
White, but with
a dark complexion

508
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,859
maybe Latino,
maybe Middle Eastern

509
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,859
but he didn't have an accent
as far as I remember

510
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,159
and...I don't know.

511
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:25,059
I'm just afraid that what I do
remember I'm making up because

512
00:19:25,093 --> 00:19:27,859
I‐I just don't want
to be of no help to them.

513
00:19:27,893 --> 00:19:31,393
Well, maybe talking
to him scared him off.

514
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:36,193
CT Confirmed a small
splenic laceration.

515
00:19:36,226 --> 00:19:38,493
Romano wants to do an ex‐lap.

516
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,993
He's going to operate?

517
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:41,393
Not that an operation
is going to mean

518
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,259
much to Miss Heller
but according to Robert

519
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:45,059
she's a liability nightmare.

520
00:19:45,093 --> 00:19:46,826
What do you think?

521
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,993
I think it's better
than doing nothing.

522
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,159
Poor woman already
got pushed down an escalator.

523
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,193
It wasn't intentional.

524
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,259
Now you want her
to sit here

525
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,959
while I go get
my stinking badge?

526
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,993
Hey, you're supposed
to wear your ID at all times.

527
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:00,559
Since when does
the Chicago PD Care?

528
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,859
‐ Officer, I can vouch for him.
‐ Thank you.

529
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:04,326
What's the deal?
You'd think I was a felon.

530
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,393
Is this Mark Greene's scalp lac?

531
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:06,593
‐ That's me.
‐ Yeah.

532
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:08,226
CT gave the green light
to stitch away.

533
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,593
Okay. I want you to put
her in the suture room

534
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,993
and Tony, wear your ID.

535
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,393
‐ How come?
‐ Because I said so.

536
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:15,459
Carter, I heard
a terrible rumor.

537
00:20:15,493 --> 00:20:17,893
Oh, yeah. Apparently,
a patient got assaulted and‐‐

538
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,359
Yeah. Yeah.
That is true

539
00:20:19,393 --> 00:20:21,193
but I was asking
about Roxanne.

540
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,359
Did you break up with her?

541
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,959
‐ Who told you that?
‐ She did.

542
00:20:23,993 --> 00:20:25,559
Oh. Yeah, it's true.

543
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:28,126
So, she won't be
coming around anymore.

544
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,826
Man, can't you think
of the rest of us?

545
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:33,093
‐ Oh, you liked her?
‐ What's not to like?

546
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:34,193
Hey, Carter, can you come?

547
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,459
Miss Farr is a little altered.

548
00:20:35,493 --> 00:20:37,293
Lucy wants to send her
for a head CT.

549
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:40,026
Doesn't Lucy
have her own patient?

550
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:43,926
What's this one called?

551
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,359
Oh, shoot.
What is that?

552
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:47,859
It's right on the tip
of my tongue.

553
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:49,493
Hey, Lucy.

554
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:52,526
Did you get that hip x‐ray
results back on Mrs. Armstrong?

555
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,493
No, It's not done yet
and psych is on their way down.

556
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:55,959
'Good.'

557
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,159
I actually,
I'm little worried.

558
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:58,926
Miss Farr seems
a little bit confused‐‐

559
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:00,459
I'll check it out.

560
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,559
I think with her history,
she should probably have‐‐

561
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,926
Yeah, I'll handle it.

562
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,426
I'll see you
later, Miss Farr.

563
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:07,193
Sex.

564
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,993
What?

565
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,059
That's the name of the scent.

566
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,159
"Pher‐sex."

567
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,059
So your head hurts?

568
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:18,093
It might be stuffy in here.

569
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,226
Maybe we should put
your perfumes away.

570
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:22,393
Some of them are
a little strong.

571
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:25,259
You have a very slender nose.

572
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:27,826
‐ Do I?
‐ It makes common sense.

573
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,559
The size of
the VNO would correspond

574
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,893
to the size of the nasal cavity.

575
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:34,259
‐ VNO?
‐ Vomeronasal Organ.

576
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,893
The structure
that picks up subtle messages

577
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,393
from other
people's glands.

578
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:41,093
Do you find yourself
affected by the opposite sex?

579
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,826
Oh, I'd say, I, uh...
I notice them.

580
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,859
What about your ability to bond?

581
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:50,559
‐ Follow my finger.
‐ Mmm.

582
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,926
Are you experiencing any
weakness or numbness, Miss Farr?

583
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,326
See, people with deficient VNOs

584
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,026
often have, uh, trouble

585
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,059
sort of appreciating oxytocin

586
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:01,493
which is the hormone
that provokes deep inimacy

587
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:04,493
inta‐intim‐intimacy.

588
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:06,026
Lydia, I think we should
set Miss Farr up

589
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,559
with a head CT.

590
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,459
‐ Dr. Carter?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

591
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,559
Were you breast‐fed?

592
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,393
So, I heard I missed
another trauma.

593
00:22:17,426 --> 00:22:18,893
Tragic case, actually.

594
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,426
Is Romano doing the ex‐lap?

595
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:23,059
It's perfectly routine. You
needn't join us if you're busy.

596
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,826
Yeah, well, he'll
need an assist.

597
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,026
We both know
I can handle that.

598
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:27,559
Elizabeth, you're an intern.

599
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:30,059
Stop seeing every move
I make as a competition, okay?

600
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,559
Huh, right.

601
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:34,126
Just the way I see it,
it looks as though

602
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,059
you're going for the trauma
fellowship full bore.

603
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:37,893
I haven't made
up my mind yet.

604
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:40,493
My, my, my, how many surgical
heavyweights does it take

605
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,059
to screw in
a light bulb?

606
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:45,293
It depends on what's
at stake, I guess.

607
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,126
I heard you were
zonked out in the lounge.

608
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,259
I closed my eyes
for two minutes.

609
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,126
‐ I was on a break.
‐ Okay.

610
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:56,359
I'm entitled
to a break

611
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:57,593
15 minutes,
every four hours.

612
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,359
I know. I've just
never seen you take one.

613
00:23:00,393 --> 00:23:01,926
Well, I'm going to start.

614
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,193
I need to fax this.

615
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:05,259
Be my guest.
Or you want me to, uh‐‐

616
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:06,959
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
It's kind of personal.

617
00:23:06,993 --> 00:23:08,459
I'll do it myself,
if that's okay.

618
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:11,293
Do I look like
Kerry Weaver?

619
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:30,126
A‐ah. It looks like
we're out again.

620
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,026
Uh‐oh. Uh‐uh.

621
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,193
'Damn. I wish I hadn't
just made that incision.'

622
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,093
'It's okay. I can see
enough to suction.'

623
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,393
'I've got nothing.'

624
00:23:39,426 --> 00:23:41,159
'Alright, everybody hold on.'

625
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:42,926
The auxiliary power
will kick in.

626
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,193
Don't worry, Miss Farr. We keep
flashlights by all the..

627
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,559
Whoa.

628
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,926
Aah.

629
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,193
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ What did I spill?

630
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:56,393
Damn it.

631
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:59,359
A‐auxiliary power
is online.

632
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:02,226
Come on...damn it.
Damn it.

633
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:04,293
Carol, I need
you on task. Hit every room.

634
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:06,959
Make sure all vents and pumps
are in redundant plugs.

635
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:08,426
‐ Yep. I know. I'm coming.
‐ What the hell is going on?

636
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,893
Hey, do you
have any batteries back there?

637
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:11,093
My flash light's on a blink.

638
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:12,826
Oh, leave it for
the cops to be prepared.

639
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,359
Hey, is this all the lighting
we're going to get?

640
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:17,026
Lighting is not
priority use. Carol?

641
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:19,159
Yeah, uh, Jerry, could you try
and get my letter out of it?

642
00:24:19,193 --> 00:24:20,426
Yeah, I'm doing my best.

643
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,193
Okay. We're going
to follow the plan.

644
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:24,826
Critical equipment first,
patient concerns second.

645
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,059
Right.

646
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:28,159
I wish it weren't
getting dark.

647
00:24:28,193 --> 00:24:29,426
What about the rapist?

648
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,293
‐ Still missing.
‐ Oh, no.

649
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:33,126
Look, everyone please calm down.

650
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:34,493
Everything is under control.

651
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,259
Don't worry, Mr. Haskins.

652
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,993
We do have a loss of power

653
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:59,393
but our backup generators will
supply power to the ventilator

654
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:01,026
that's helping you breathe

655
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:03,259
as well as to the pumps
that delivers your meds, okay?

656
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,259
'We need some light over here.'

657
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:09,059
'I think Lucy's
getting a flashlight.'

658
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:12,326
‐ Uh‐h, there we go.
‐ Oh, no, Gladys.

659
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,893
The red plugs are
for priority medical use.

660
00:25:14,926 --> 00:25:16,093
Why?

661
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:19,559
We need to conserve
our auxiliary power.

662
00:25:19,593 --> 00:25:21,359
Carol, Dr. Greene's
looking for you.

663
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:23,293
The ICU wants
to send down six criticals.

664
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:24,926
Six?

665
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,993
Apparently, they
have this new backup generator

666
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,259
that never came on.

667
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,893
Oh, boy. Here.

668
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,026
Um, Mr. Armstrong..

669
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,826
...this is Dr. Myers
from psych

670
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:35,126
and he just wanted
to talk to you in another room

671
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,026
for a few minutes
if that's okay.

672
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,493
Everyone
is welcome to stay

673
00:25:39,526 --> 00:25:41,159
but until city power
is restored

674
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:44,059
we won't be starting
any non‐critical cases.

675
00:25:44,093 --> 00:25:45,493
Try 670. I'm telling you.

676
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:48,426
‐ 670 is not transmitting.
‐ Jerry?

677
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,326
‐ Static is all I can hear.
‐ Well, shut up and listen.

678
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,126
Jerry, I'm not getting
a line on this phone.

679
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,393
‐ Outside lines don't work.
‐ Now, this is the PT line.

680
00:25:54,426 --> 00:25:55,926
It's hardwired to
the ICU, isn't it?

681
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:57,926
Mark, we can't possibly
take six more criticals.

682
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,926
I know, I know, that's why
I'm trying to offer the ICU

683
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,193
four of our
life‐paks instead.

684
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,459
That'll only give
us two life‐paks.

685
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:03,559
Well, what can I do?

686
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:05,393
Officer, can
you get radio contact

687
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:06,859
with the ICU
on the seventh floor?

688
00:26:06,893 --> 00:26:08,393
I can. Beat
three to 740.

689
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,393
‐ What's that noise?
‐ Uh, sounds like a low battery.

690
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:13,026
‐ I'll find out.
‐ Thank you.

691
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,259
Whoa, Carter, Carter.

692
00:26:14,293 --> 00:26:15,393
‐ Sorry, Carol. Sorry.
‐ Slow down.

693
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:18,826
What's that smell?

694
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,359
'No retroperitoneal bleeding.'

695
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,393
The liver, duodenum
and pancreas look okay.

696
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:23,526
This isn't so bad.

697
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,259
Makes you hopeful
about Y2K.

698
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,226
Dr. Benton, it's out everywhere
in the building.

699
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,426
‐ Did you try calling?
‐ Couldn't get through.

700
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,359
Go check
on the little nipper, Peter.

701
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:33,026
I, uh, it's Reese, you know.

702
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,326
He has this thing
about the dark.

703
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,093
It is just a spleen.

704
00:26:36,126 --> 00:26:37,559
Shirley, do you have
an extra flashlight?

705
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:39,226
We'll fix you up.

706
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:40,559
This is bull.
I want a smoke.

707
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:43,559
Believe me, we would love
to let you out, okay.

708
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:46,426
I‐I got the code here.

709
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:49,259
‐ That it?
‐ Nada.

710
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:51,159
I don't think
the keypad's getting any juice.

711
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,159
Fine. I'll smoke in here.

712
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:56,159
Jerry, why don't you walk that
guy out the employee entrance

713
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:58,193
and call engineering
and get them down here.

714
00:26:58,226 --> 00:27:00,359
'An hour. You need an hour
to get a protime?'

715
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:01,926
I‐I can't wait that long.

716
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,393
What? Did an animal
die around here?

717
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:05,126
Anyone see where psych
took Mr. Armstrong?

718
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,459
Look, CT is down.

719
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,326
This woman has a history
of embolic CVAs

720
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,893
and now she's altered.

721
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:11,393
‐ Miss Farr is worse?
‐ Who is Miss Farr?

722
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:12,893
I knew she needed a CT.

723
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:15,459
Uh‐oh.

724
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:17,193
Aren't we closed
to internal disaster?

725
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:18,526
Well, maybe they didn't
get the news.

726
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,559
Listen, just get it done.

727
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,293
Hey, what's with the doors?

728
00:27:23,326 --> 00:27:25,959
I think the generator's
on a magnetic lock

729
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:28,193
and the keypad
which releases the door

730
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:29,459
is on non‐essential power.

731
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:30,593
'What does that mean?'

732
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:33,226
'Means we're screwed.'

733
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,493
Open up.

734
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:36,193
Yeah. We're trying to.

735
00:27:36,226 --> 00:27:37,226
Do you have anything
on the truck

736
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,259
to pry open the doors?

737
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,959
I'll check.

738
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,493
We've got a 33‐year‐old
Chicago Ed repairman down.

739
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,459
‐ Can you hear me?
‐ Yeah, yeah. Go on.

740
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,226
A possible electrocution
in a 15‐foot fall.

741
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,593
He was found unconscious

742
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:51,159
by his coworkers at the foot
of a power pole.

743
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:52,826
'Frequent PVCs
in the field.'

744
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,559
‐ Normal sinus now.
‐ Here, let me try.

745
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,059
He may have been
struck by lightning.

746
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,359
His coworker
said it hit pretty close.

747
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:00,859
Okay, people.

748
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:05,026
We're going to
take him in through the window.

749
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,993
Okay everybody, we're going
to need you to get up

750
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,293
and move to the other
side of the hall. Thank you.

751
00:28:09,326 --> 00:28:10,426
Let's get all these
chairs out of here.

752
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,193
Everything's got to go.

753
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:14,359
Eric, give me a hand.

754
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,426
‐ Can we get this window off?
‐ Let's try lifting it.

755
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,926
Can't we just smash it?
Everybody look out.

756
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,959
No, no, no. We got it,
we got it. It comes out.

757
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,326
‐ The whole thing?
‐ No, no. Just the backboard.

758
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,959
We need a gurney in here.

759
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:29,026
‐ Bring it in lengthwise.
‐ Are you ready?

760
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,559
Okay, everybody,
grab a hold.

761
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:35,426
'Easy, easy.'

762
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:38,326
Okay, you guys let go.

763
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:40,859
How you doing there?

764
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:43,226
Yep. Welcome to county general.

765
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,526
Morales get
on the radio to dispatch

766
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,359
and tell them that we are
officially closed to trauma.

767
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,426
‐ Got it.
‐ Carter, she's crashing.

768
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,459
‐ Miss Farr.
‐ Oh, no.

769
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:52,826
Get on it, both of you.

770
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,159
‐ Jerry, page Benton.
‐ Yeah.

771
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,459
Reese.

772
00:28:58,493 --> 00:28:59,493
Reese.

773
00:29:01,526 --> 00:29:03,893
'Reese, where are you?'

774
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:07,259
‐ Hey, it's daddy.
‐ Right over here Dr. Benton.

775
00:29:07,293 --> 00:29:10,126
'Hey.'

776
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,193
Hey, man.

777
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,393
What you doing?

778
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:16,459
Huh?

779
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,493
What you doing?

780
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,159
'What is that?'

781
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,859
'You looking at the stars?'

782
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,559
'Is this fun?'

783
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,493
Penny for your thoughts.

784
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:37,326
I hesitate to say.

785
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,893
We're ready to close.
4‐0 vicryl, please.

786
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:41,326
I was just thinking.

787
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,993
Miss Heller's body's
been through quite enough.

788
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:49,559
An accident, a coma,
a brutal attack

789
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:52,993
the kindest thing might be
to let her go in peace.

790
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:55,093
Of course we can't.

791
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,459
Careful what you ask for.

792
00:29:57,493 --> 00:29:59,059
She's bradying down.

793
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:00,493
Oh, don't tell me that.

794
00:30:00,526 --> 00:30:02,459
'EKG looks good.'

795
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:03,859
Looks like
a lightning strike.

796
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:05,293
I don't know.
I was up the pole.

797
00:30:05,326 --> 00:30:06,426
That's all I remember.

798
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:08,193
Yeah. Flashover effect.

799
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:10,126
I‐I want to keep that shirt.

800
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,326
It's all yours.

801
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,359
Full thickness
burns to the legs.

802
00:30:17,637 --> 00:30:18,903
Alright, what do we got?

803
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:19,937
'What have you got?'

804
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,203
Hi, Reese.

805
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,803
Mr. Joiner took
a hit of lightning.

806
00:30:22,837 --> 00:30:24,803
‐ Fell 15 feet.
‐ No guarding or tenderness.

807
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:26,170
Let's prep for
a lavage. Let's move.

808
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:28,970
Thank you.
Hang on, man.

809
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,037
Why are you doing
a naso trach?

810
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,003
We won't have to paralyze her.

811
00:30:34,037 --> 00:30:36,003
Alright. I'm in.

812
00:30:36,037 --> 00:30:38,270
Go ahead. Bag her.

813
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,070
‐ Good job.
‐ Not really.

814
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:41,303
Without a CT.

815
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,170
I have no idea
what to do next.

816
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,637
Well, don't you think
she threw a clot?

817
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,270
Maybe, if she's
inadequately anticoagulated.

818
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,837
So, she needs heparin
to thin her blood

819
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,937
and to prevent
further clotting, right?

820
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,237
Unless she's
over‐anticoagulated

821
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,570
and bleeding
in her brain.

822
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:54,903
Then she needs
vitamin K and FFP.

823
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:58,003
Heparin would kill her.

824
00:30:58,037 --> 00:30:59,903
Okay, good breath sounds.
Let's hook her up.

825
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:01,337
That's why you
needed a protime.

826
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,637
Bingo.

827
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,603
Is an AC of 14
okay on the vent?

828
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:09,603
Oh, never mind. We're dead.

829
00:31:09,637 --> 00:31:12,870
‐ Got it. I'll bag her.
‐ What the hell?

830
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,570
Oh, we've just
lost backup.

831
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:16,570
Oh, this is still
on from battery.

832
00:31:16,603 --> 00:31:18,870
Oh, god. All patients on vents
are gonna have to be bagged.

833
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:20,137
Go. Get them started.

834
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,970
I lost my monitors
for a 62 year‐old.

835
00:31:22,003 --> 00:31:23,837
History of CVA
and heart disease.

836
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,770
‐ Auxiliary power has cut out.
‐ Where's the life‐paks?

837
00:31:25,803 --> 00:31:29,037
‐ We gave the extras to ICU.
‐ Go, I'll take care of this.

838
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,570
Peter, what do you think?

839
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:31,970
This guy's stable.
She can take that one.

840
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,203
Thank you, gentlemen.

841
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:34,803
So what happened
to the generator?

842
00:31:34,837 --> 00:31:36,670
I thought it was supposed
to be foolproof.

843
00:31:36,703 --> 00:31:37,903
Yeah, but apparently not.

844
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,137
Connie, can you take
Reese from me?

845
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,037
Sure. Jerry can look after him.

846
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,970
Mark, Carter needs you.

847
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,037
Okay, go, Mark.
I got this one.

848
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,270
‐ Go. Go.
‐ Okay.

849
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:47,337
'Another unit in.'

850
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,670
Still no pressure.

851
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:50,270
Damn it. Damn it.

852
00:31:50,303 --> 00:31:51,770
Hard to believe
she's crashing.

853
00:31:51,803 --> 00:31:53,237
I can't think
without all the alarms blaring.

854
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,870
Try phenylephedrine?

855
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,303
Wait.

856
00:31:56,337 --> 00:31:57,937
The neck veins
are distended.

857
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,137
No pulse in the aorta.

858
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,670
‐ Tamponade?
‐ Exactly.

859
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:03,003
60cc syringe,
18‐gauge needle.

860
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,870
‐ Going in blind?
‐ Yeah.

861
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:08,070
Okay. Retract the left lobe
of the liver.

862
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:10,037
‐ Got it.
‐ This is living, huh?

863
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,037
Pericardiocentesis
without electronic monitor.

864
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,637
Careful, you don't
puncture the ventricle.

865
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,703
Thanks, Robert.
Got it.

866
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:17,970
Give me a minute
to check the pressure.

867
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,703
I think it's coming up.

868
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,737
Ho hum.

869
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,237
All in a day's work, huh.

870
00:32:25,803 --> 00:32:27,170
So basically, we're boned.

871
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:28,770
The wrong treatment
could kill her.

872
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:30,570
Miss Farr, don't worry.
We're here with you.

873
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,137
Our hands are tied
without the CT.

874
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,103
‐ Watch her chest expansion.
‐ I am.

875
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:36,903
‐ Whole‐blood clotting time.
‐ What?

876
00:32:36,937 --> 00:32:38,570
Something from the dark ages.

877
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,870
Oh, Lydia, you don't have
an extra red top on with you?

878
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:43,803
Of her blood? Yeah.
I always hold one.

879
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,337
How long ago
did you draw it?

880
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,970
‐ Uh, about 45 minutes ago.
‐ Okay.

881
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:52,337
Yeah. No signs
of clotting.

882
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,203
I'm going to say
she's over‐anticoagulated.

883
00:32:54,237 --> 00:32:55,270
So we just treat her?

884
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:56,970
No. We do
an LP first.

885
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,670
Miss Knight?
Do you have a minute?

886
00:32:58,703 --> 00:32:59,703
Yeah.

887
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:00,737
Oh, I'll take over.

888
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,337
Alright, good news.
Lavage is negative.

889
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,937
Oh, there's blood
in the urine.

890
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,170
Well, he could have ruptured
his bladder or kidneys.

891
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,103
No CT you want to do an ex‐lap?

892
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:12,737
What, and carry him up?
Let me see this.

893
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,103
Alright, let's get
a specimen cup

894
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:15,570
and set up a microscope.

895
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:16,970
Uh‐oh. I've lost his pulse.

896
00:33:17,003 --> 00:33:18,337
‐ What?
‐ He's in v‐tach.

897
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,703
Oh, damn. Move.

898
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,970
Let's get
the defibrillator back.

899
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,070
Carol, where's Haleh's patient?

900
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:28,237
Oh, exam one.

901
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,037
‐ You okay in here?
‐ Fine.

902
00:33:40,037 --> 00:33:41,303
Get away from her.

903
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:43,970
‐ What the hell?
‐ Step back. Security.

904
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,837
‐ Hey, relax.
‐ Who are you?

905
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,137
I'm Tom Frawley.
I'm an RN at mercy

906
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,303
but I live down the block.

907
00:33:49,337 --> 00:33:50,903
‐ Do you have ID?
‐ Yeah.

908
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:52,237
'I came in to help with
the power outage.'

909
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,270
'They told me to irrigate
her scalp lac.'

910
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:57,037
He's doing
a real nice job.

911
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,903
Okay, I'm...I'm sorry.
I didn't know you.

912
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:05,270
It's okay.

913
00:34:05,303 --> 00:34:06,970
'It was a good pick‐up
on Mr. Armstrong.'

914
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,037
I've got him on ativan.

915
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,670
Yeah. he seemed pretty
depressed.

916
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:11,803
Worse than that.
He's having suicidal ideation.

917
00:34:11,837 --> 00:34:13,103
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah, no guy like that.

918
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:14,670
It happens more
than people know.

919
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:15,970
A lot of thoughts
of pulling the trigger.

920
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:18,070
He's definitely
a danger to himself.

921
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:20,103
What about others?

922
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:21,137
'I need that.'

923
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,603
Keep your finger on her pulse.

924
00:34:22,637 --> 00:34:24,003
I'll bring it back
as soon as I can.

925
00:34:24,037 --> 00:34:25,603
‐ Still no pulse.
‐ I'll hook up the leads.

926
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:29,003
Don't bother.
I'll take a quick look.

927
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,303
Ah, he's in fib.
Let's shock him at 200.

928
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:37,037
‐ Set.
‐ Clear.

929
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,670
Damn it. 300. Clear.

930
00:34:41,337 --> 00:34:43,137
‐ 375. Clear.
‐ It's not charged yet.

931
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,970
‐ Hold on.
‐ Batteries take longer.

932
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:46,270
'Yeah, we'll be lucky if
there's a charge left.'

933
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:48,103
‐ Come on, come on.
‐ Set.

934
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:50,003
Clear.

935
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:52,070
‐ Got it. Thank god.
‐ Alright, that's more like it.

936
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:54,237
Okay, lets push lidocaine to 100
and keep an eye on him.

937
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,903
Where's the microscope?

938
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:58,637
‐ How am I doing here?
‐ Great.

939
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,603
Maybe I'll take
the M‐cats.

940
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:02,337
Such a long way down.

941
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:04,037
I know, Dottie.

942
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,770
So Gladys you said
you heard a bang

943
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,070
when you walked up to the door?

944
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:08,770
I did.

945
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,903
And you could hear Dottie
fall down the back stoop

946
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:12,303
even without
your hearing aid?

947
00:35:12,337 --> 00:35:14,303
Well, I heard a bang.

948
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:17,170
Can you see okay?

949
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,303
Yes.

950
00:35:19,337 --> 00:35:23,703
That bedsore's
a bad one, isn't it?

951
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:25,903
It's not a bedsore.

952
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,903
'Kerry?'

953
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:35,703
Yep. Anyone want
fried chicken?

954
00:35:35,737 --> 00:35:37,737
Oh, my god,
you read my mind.

955
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,270
Hey, who fixed the doors?

956
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,070
Oh, they popped open when
we lost the generators.

957
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:43,803
You lost a generator?
That's scary. Hey, Reese.

958
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:45,903
Yeah, it is scary.
It's been 40 minutes.

959
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,070
Our battery packs
are only guaranteed for 45.

960
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:49,937
Hey, this chicken
smells great.

961
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,870
Yeah, everything in my freezer
was going to mush.

962
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,937
It was cook it or lose it.

963
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,003
‐ You made this?
‐ Yep, always cook with gas.

964
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,603
So, what can I do?

965
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:59,637
Well, I've already checked
all the exam beds.

966
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,170
See if Benton needs help
in trauma one.

967
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,270
And Kerry, thank you so much.

968
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:04,903
‐ So good.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

969
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,803
'Prepped with
the vitamin K?'

970
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,870
'And mannitol in case
she herniates.'

971
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:16,870
Don't worry, Carter,
I'm using a 22‐gauge needle.

972
00:36:16,903 --> 00:36:17,903
You holding up, Lydia?

973
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:20,003
Oh, yeah, strong hands.

974
00:36:20,037 --> 00:36:21,770
'Don't be afraid
to let Carter know'

975
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:24,103
'if you need
to be spelled.'

976
00:36:26,803 --> 00:36:28,570
Good.

977
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:32,003
Let's get the FFP.

978
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:34,070
Give vitamin K,
ten milligrams

979
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:36,037
slow IV Push.

980
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,270
How are
the pupils, Carter?

981
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:39,837
Equal and reactive.

982
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,670
Thanks for the backup.

983
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,737
No problem.

984
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,237
And he zaps the guy back
with one shot to spare.

985
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,270
Then he's sticking
a slide of urine

986
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:49,303
under the microscope.

987
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:50,670
And it's bright red.

988
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:51,903
He's telling
us it's not blood.

989
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:53,203
Rhabdomyolysis, huh?

990
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:54,837
And myglobinuria.

991
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,137
The guy was breaking
down muscle probably from

992
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,570
the lightning and trauma.

993
00:36:57,603 --> 00:36:59,003
Just needed to get
fluids on board.

994
00:36:59,037 --> 00:37:00,237
Sounds like you
didn't need me at all.

995
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,703
I don't know.

996
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:03,837
Didn't you say something
about some chicken?

997
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,970
Well‐done, Dr. Corday.

998
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,837
Thank you.

999
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,103
I'd be remiss
if I didn't say this

1000
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:29,203
especially after today.

1001
00:37:29,237 --> 00:37:31,003
You are an exceptional surgeon.

1002
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:32,270
It would be tragic for you

1003
00:37:32,303 --> 00:37:34,103
to waste your time
on some trauma fellowship.

1004
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,237
Let me finish.

1005
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,203
Now..

1006
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:47,003
...I'm aware that you don't
relish working with me.

1007
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:50,570
I'm in your face.
I can't resist.

1008
00:37:50,603 --> 00:37:55,003
But, know this..

1009
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:56,170
...I would do anything
in my power

1010
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:57,903
to have you stay in surgery.

1011
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,803
Including making myself
as scarce as possible.

1012
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:07,903
I appreciate that.

1013
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,803
Think about it.

1014
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,803
I'll take over.

1015
00:38:21,837 --> 00:38:23,737
The cops want to see you.

1016
00:38:38,837 --> 00:38:39,870
The facility engineers

1017
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,570
found him in
the switch room.

1018
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,037
He hung himself.

1019
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:08,670
Is that the guy?

1020
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:14,937
Yeah, that's him.

1021
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,837
Let's get everybody
back on vent.

1022
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,770
‐ And reboot all monitors.
‐ You got it.

1023
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:27,870
This place is a mess.

1024
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:29,270
Hey, CTs holding a table

1025
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:30,303
if you can get her
there in two minutes.

1026
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:32,170
How are you doing, Mrs. Farr?

1027
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,103
Yeah. we're going to take that
out as soon as you come back.

1028
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,970
Don't worry, I was very
careful with your VNO.

1029
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:38,803
So, Carter,
I need to ask you.

1030
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,870
W‐what was going in there?

1031
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:42,670
I was, I was worried
that she'd herniate.

1032
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,237
No, no, I mean
between you and me.

1033
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,637
I was getting this
weird energy.

1034
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,570
I mean, it was
almost like you were, what

1035
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,103
you were being
territorial

1036
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,037
or admiring me.

1037
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,637
Ah, I don't want to say
that you were flirting

1038
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:56,037
'cause I mean obviously
you weren't

1039
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,737
you know, you weren't
flirting with me.

1040
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,137
Oh, man, you know, I spilled
those pheromones on me.

1041
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,303
‐ Like, a whole bottle.
‐ Is that what I smell?

1042
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:05,637
Maybe that's what
you were picking up on

1043
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,770
one of those chemicals.

1044
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,303
Wow, that's
pretty far‐fetched.

1045
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:10,837
I mean, I admired you

1046
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,037
when you went
for the LP.

1047
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,103
But, you know,
that was it.

1048
00:40:15,137 --> 00:40:17,137
I better get these
to the lab.

1049
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,237
‐ Get him?
‐ Got him.

1050
00:40:24,337 --> 00:40:29,237
Ten months after I retire,
they were bought out.

1051
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,937
Our health plan's kaput.

1052
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,203
She can't get out of bed.

1053
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,237
I‐I wrote my pension wrong.

1054
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:46,237
If I go first, she gets nothing.

1055
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,137
I had to take
care of her.

1056
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,903
I know.

1057
00:40:49,937 --> 00:40:54,670
But what I don't
know about is the bullet.

1058
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,103
What kind it was

1059
00:40:56,137 --> 00:41:00,303
and...whether you were
firing from above.

1060
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:01,870
And in that case

1061
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,037
it might have
hit her bladder.

1062
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,203
Or if you were aiming

1063
00:41:04,237 --> 00:41:06,137
directly at her spine.

1064
00:41:08,203 --> 00:41:09,737
Ah, w‐well..

1065
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,337
...it‐it was
a Walther automatic.

1066
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:20,037
I took it off a German officer.

1067
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,970
Uh, the..

1068
00:41:22,003 --> 00:41:28,003
...th‐the army g‐gave me
papers for it.

1069
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:34,203
At the end of the war,
pistols were the only thing

1070
00:41:34,237 --> 00:41:37,703
they'd let us GIs keep.

1071
00:41:40,803 --> 00:41:43,003
I see.

1072
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,837
‐ God, what a day.
‐ Yeah.

1073
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,270
ComEd says there was arcing
at the substation.

1074
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:52,070
According to facilities, our
back‐up generator shut down

1075
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:54,203
because of a failed bearing
in the fan motor

1076
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:55,603
that cools the system.

1077
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,137
Oh, that makes
it all clear.

1078
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,803
I'll admit it. I'm not 100%
comfortable in the dark.

1079
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:01,170
Oh, I guess
a candlelit dinner

1080
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:03,837
would not be
an enticing offer?

1081
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:06,270
I'm afraid not.
I'm heading home.

1082
00:42:06,303 --> 00:42:07,903
Some advice.
I wouldn't do that.

1083
00:42:07,937 --> 00:42:09,003
‐ Oh?
‐ Yeah.

1084
00:42:09,037 --> 00:42:10,703
Rule number
one of trauma.

1085
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,603
After a day like today,
you should shift gears

1086
00:42:13,637 --> 00:42:14,937
not take it home with you.

1087
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,103
So what do you suggest?

1088
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:19,270
Okay, Jerry, we're out of here.

1089
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,337
Okay. I hope you guys
have power at home.

1090
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,103
We'll be fine.

1091
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:32,270
‐ You looking for this?
‐ Oh, you got it out.

1092
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:33,970
Yeah, the transmission
didn't go through

1093
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:35,670
and I didn't have
a number to send it again.

1094
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:37,237
That's okay,
I'm, I'll fax it later.

1095
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,770
‐ Okay.
‐ Did you read it?

1096
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,670
No, you said
it was personal.

1097
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,337
'So the neighbor
interrupted a suicide pact?'

1098
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,903
No, I wouldn't exactly
call it that.

1099
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:49,770
The wife wasn't in on it.

1100
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:51,703
Myers said it's
not unheard of

1101
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,337
depression over aging,
loss of control

1102
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,770
a downward spiral.

1103
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:57,803
How long were they married?

1104
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,070
54 years.

1105
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:02,337
'It makes you wonder if
something was always missing.'

1106
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,003
Hmm?

1107
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:05,237
Oh, I'm not the one to ask

1108
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,870
what makes a lasting
relationship.

1109
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,337
Oh?

1110
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,303
Never had a lasting
relationship.

1111
00:43:12,337 --> 00:43:13,903
Not that
I don't want to..

1112
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:15,737
...find that someone.

1113
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,870
Just haven't.

1114
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,603
I know.

1115
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:22,703
Your parents stayed together
but they completely shut you out

1116
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:24,570
and lived like
childless jet‐setters

1117
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,670
and they made marriage
a complete mystery to you.

1118
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,103
No.

1119
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:31,270
My problem,
on the other hand, is that

1120
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:35,870
I was raised by such a capable,
self‐sufficient single mom

1121
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:37,837
that it's hard for me to see
the need for a partner at all.

1122
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:42,637
How long was
that psych rotation?

1123
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,270
Go, go, go, go.

1124
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:56,703
Good, good.

1125
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:58,737
Go, go.
Hang in there.

1126
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,903
That's the hard part.

1127
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:04,903
You just got
to watch out.

1128
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,570
Hey, you have a go.

1129
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:10,303
No, no, no, after
a fall like that‐‐

1130
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:12,570
I'd be in traction
for the rest of the season.

1131
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:15,970
No, no, you got to get back up
on your skis, on the slopes.

1132
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:18,170
Okay, I can do this.

1133
00:44:18,203 --> 00:44:19,703
You can do anything.

1134
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:23,137
'Three, two, one.'

1135
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,570
Okay, and go.

1136
00:44:25,603 --> 00:44:28,003
God bless electricity.

1137
00:44:28,037 --> 00:44:29,070
Go, go, go.

1138
00:44:34,203 --> 00:44:35,870
'Why did I have
to bring that up?'

1139
00:44:35,903 --> 00:44:37,170
'Ah, just give it a minute.'
