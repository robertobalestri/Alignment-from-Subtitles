1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,666
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:10,633
I think these results

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,800
don't have anything
to do with the accident.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,366
All this time,
I'm worrying about HIV

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,333
and I get Hepatitis‐C?

6
00:00:17,366 --> 00:00:18,400
Why don't you
do what I did?

7
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,166
Apply to
a locum tenens program

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,266
filling in for vacationing
surgeons in rural hospitals.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,766
They pay you a bundle
to step in.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,233
Oh, yeah? What's a bundle?

11
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:27,366
Eight, ten grand
for a couple weeks.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,233
'Can you say "father?"'

13
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:30,800
Can you say "daddy?"

14
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:32,066
'Yeah.'

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,533
'Hey, Peter.'

16
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,800
‐ Morning.
‐ Hey. Morning.

17
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,300
Wow, all this
for just two weeks?

18
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,566
Well, it's been 30 below
in North Minnesota.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,066
Ah‐huh. So, will you be the only
surgeon in this hospital?

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,600
No. One of three.

21
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,333
So, you're all set?

22
00:00:51,366 --> 00:00:53,733
Yeah. I mean, it's tough
getting Reese squared away.

23
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,200
Carla can't pick him up
from daycare on Thursday

24
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,500
and that's
Jackie's rough day

25
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,300
but, you know,
other than that..

26
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:00,766
Well, I can cover.

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,300
No, no, no.

28
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,733
I couldn't ask you.

29
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,633
You didn't.
I just offered.

30
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,300
What are friends for?

31
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay. Yeah.

32
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,266
Have Dr. Edson follow up
on these before discharge.

33
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,466
The weather channel said

34
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,066
a front's moving
across the Rockies.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,366
Hope you packed
your long Johns.

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,766
I'm wearing
my long Johns.

37
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,066
Peter.
Good thing I caught you.

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,333
The locum tenens folks
just called.

39
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:27,033
Change of plans. You
are needed at another location.

40
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,366
You better hustle. Your flight
for Atlanta leaves in an hour.

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,733
I'm going to Atlanta?

42
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,300
You're connecting
from there to Biloxi.

43
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,600
I didn't sign
up for Biloxi.

44
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:35,300
Biloxi's where you're
picking up a rental car.

45
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,533
Then you still have a few
hours' drive to Laverne.

46
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,033
Laverne?
Whoa, wait a minute.

47
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,500
I signed a contract.

48
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,466
These people can't just
switch this at the last minute.

49
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,100
Well, that's what the fine print
is all about, but I'm sure

50
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,733
it's a medical necessity
and you can't back out now

51
00:01:46,766 --> 00:01:48,400
or else we'll both look
very unhippocratic.

52
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,033
Besides, you're going
to need the dough

53
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,200
if you accept the cardiothoracic
fellowship next year.

54
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,700
You're offering me
a cardiothoracic spot?

55
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,333
Well, not officially until May,
but between you and me..

56
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,600
'Isn't it a pain that the most
prestigious fellowships'

57
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,100
'always pay the least?'

58
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,366
It's like you're
supposed to be honored

59
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,266
to let them put you
deeper in debt.

60
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,066
Have a good trip.

61
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
‐ 'I'm sorry. It's the rules.'
‐ Let me up. I work here.

62
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,433
Please, ma'am, I
could lose my job.

63
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,766
I feel like an idiot
in this thing.

64
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,533
Hey, Jeanie, you being
discharged today?

65
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:17,300
Yep. One final indignity.

66
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,366
Excuse me, miss, miss,
you know what, I'm running out.

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,466
I'll take over
from here, okay?

68
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,600
Be my guest.

69
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,166
Go, go, go, go.

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,233
So, you're lucky you didn't,
uh, break any bones.

71
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,533
Yeah. Apparently, the windshield
looks a lot worse than I do.

72
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:30,100
Yeah. Hey, listen,
I'm sorry about the hep‐C.

73
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,466
Hepatitis doesn't scare me.

74
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,033
Dr. Makadon thinks
I'll respond well to the meds.

75
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:35,400
Where you off to?

76
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,433
Oh, I'm doing a stint
at a rural hospital.

77
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:40,766
At the last minute, they stuck
me in the middle of nowhere.

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,133
In Mississippi,
a place called Laverne.

79
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,700
‐ You're kidding? Laverne?
‐ Yeah, you know it?

80
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,233
I have aunts and uncles all over
that part of Mississippi.

81
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,066
On my father's side,
the Murdocks.

82
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,500
I can give you
some phone numbers.

83
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,700
I don't know how much free time
I'm going to have.

84
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,500
Mmm. I haven't been there
since I was a kid.

85
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:58,133
‐ I used to love that place.
‐ Oh, yeah?

86
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,033
I used to climb trees
and get dirty

87
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,633
and they're all
great cooks.

88
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,700
Well, uh,
I'll keep an eye out.

89
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:07,033
Listen, if you run into
any of my relatives

90
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:08,733
just don't mention
my HIV status.

91
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,300
Of course not.

92
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,366
I haven't told anyone
in my family.

93
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,133
Just give them my love.

94
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,633
Yeah, yeah, sure.

95
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:28,033
♪ Mm‐hmm‐mmm ♪

96
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:31,033
♪ Mm‐hmm‐mmm ♪

97
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,666
♪ Mm‐hmm‐mmm ♪

98
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,066
Hey, how you doing?

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,266
Can't complain.

100
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,800
Is there a phone inside?

101
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,633
Sorry.

102
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,333
My car broke down. I need to
call the hospital in Laverne.

103
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:47,000
Son...you in Laverne.

104
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,666
Is there a hospital here?

105
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,400
Who you looking for?

106
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,733
Okay, Tavius, this looks
real good, but I want you..

107
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:57,266
'Maureen?'

108
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,533
...to keep the patch on
it for a couple of days.

109
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,633
Excuse me a minute.

110
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,366
This gentleman
looking for you.

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,100
Miss Chapman,
I'm Dr. Benton.

112
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,500
Oh, I'd given up.

113
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,400
They said you'd
be here yesterday.

114
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,400
I didn't know I was
coming here till this morning.

115
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,733
You're here for a month?

116
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,566
No, no, no. Two weeks.

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,666
Hear that, leg?
You've got two weeks.

118
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,566
I'm a nurse
practitioner.

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm supposed to
stay off my feet

120
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,800
but all these patients
keep getting sick.

121
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,633
So, there's no hospital here?
I mean, just a clinic?

122
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,233
Our nearest hospital is
80 miles, in Green Cove.

123
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,166
What, you walk here?

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,366
His car broke down
on Barney Jones Road.

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Oh, well,
my boy is good with engines.

126
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,800
Sonny?

127
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,266
He'll take care of you.

128
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,266
Is the head doctor
on duty now?

129
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,400
Dr. Benton,
you are the doctor

130
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,033
and please don't tell me
that you're a dentist.

131
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,166
Okay, sweetie, I want
you to keep that..

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,433
I'm a fifth‐year
surgical resident.

133
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,200
Oh, Lord.

134
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,333
Sonny..

135
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:58,266
'Dr. Benton's
car broke down.'

136
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,600
Yeah, I seen it.

137
00:06:59,633 --> 00:07:01,733
'You think you
can fix it up?'

138
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:04,533
You're hurting. Get to bed.

139
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:07,366
'Well, I need to help
Dr. Benton get settled.'

140
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,133
'No, no, no, no.
You know what?'

141
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:12,300
'There are only
a few patients here so, um..'

142
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,800
What time do you close?

143
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,033
When the last
patient's gone.

144
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,400
Have you ever
practiced medicine?

145
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,133
I can handle it.

146
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,400
'Let's go.'

147
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,766
'Alright, suit yourself.'

148
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,333
Um, weather like this,
folks sit out here

149
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,700
and you see them
inside, and, um..

150
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:33,266
I expect you'll find everything
where it should be, and..

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,433
'Oh, everybody,
this is Dr. Benton..'

152
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:38,066
'...from Chicago. He's gonna
take care of y'all.'

153
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,466
Alright.

154
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
Who's next?

155
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,066
Bentons.

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,566
I don't recollect any Bentons.

157
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,233
My family's
not from around here.

158
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,733
So...what can I do
for you today?

159
00:07:56,766 --> 00:08:00,433
Might've been some Bentons
over near Hattiesburg.

160
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:02,066
I believe it's so.

161
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,366
'Course, there was
this schoolteacher Benton'

162
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,666
over to Winona.
She was a white lady.

163
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,133
Died of consumption.
Coughed herself to the grave.

164
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,600
Ms. Johnson,
uh, what is your complaint?

165
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:15,766
Oh, I ain't got no complaint.

166
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,233
No need to complain,
and complaining make it worse

167
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,733
what they say.

168
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,300
Do you have a medical problem?

169
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,500
No. J‐Just the burn.

170
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:29,733
Okay, so, where's the burn?

171
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:33,700
I believe there's some Bentons
up off the riverfront.

172
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,700
Or maybe Benders.

173
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:40,366
Maybe they was Benders.

174
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,533
'Mmm. Benders.'

175
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,366
Mr. McCoy?

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,000
Ruth Blalock?

177
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,100
‐ They left?
‐ Appears so.

178
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:56,566
Jesse Morgan.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,266
That's me.

180
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,633
I figured I‐I'd let you
take a look at my leg.

181
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,733
That's okay, Mr. Morgan,
you can stay seated.

182
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,433
Sorry it took so long.

183
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,100
That's a pretty
nasty‐looking ulcer.

184
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,533
Yes, sir.

185
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:16,666
I tried mustard seed on it.

186
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,133
That usually stops my leg
from aching.

187
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,700
No, no, no, no. You're going
to need some antibiotics

188
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,133
and you need
to stay off this foot

189
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,466
and you need to soak it
three times a day

190
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,600
in warm water, okay?

191
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,700
Stay off it?

192
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,700
‐ And soak it?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

193
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,666
'Where do I put this, doctor?'

194
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,033
Excuse me?
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,700
Uh, you can put it
on the counter inside.

196
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,033
We'll send it out to the lab
or however they handle it.

197
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:40,333
Does Miss Chapman have a number
where we can reach you?

198
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:43,466
Oh, Maureen
tells me on the spot.

199
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,133
You take this in the back room,
and you do your test.

200
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,533
Mr. Morgan.

201
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,166
Miss Pearl.

202
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,366
'Well, how about the Greens?'

203
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,700
'You can pick out
the ham hocks.'

204
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,800
'No, thank you.'

205
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,266
I'll just have another biscuit.

206
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,333
After Dr. Rajiv..
He lasted about a month.

207
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,166
We sort of gave up.

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,066
It's hard to keep
a doctor here.

209
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,766
Well, I can see why.

210
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,100
‐ No offense.
‐ Oh, none taken.

211
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,633
We was doing fine
until you thought

212
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,166
you was more stubborn
than that mare.

213
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
Fractured your leg, huh?

214
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:26,733
Ligaments in my knee
and a herniated cervical disc.

215
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:31,366
I guess it's lucky
that you don't mind lard.

216
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm sorry

217
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,600
you missed your son.

218
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,400
What, had he
gone to bed?

219
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,600
I heard you send your love.

220
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:43,733
No.

221
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:47,266
My son is deaf,
so the phone is of no use to us.

222
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,366
I'd arranged
for a videophone hookup

223
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,633
at the hospital in Minnesota..

224
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,033
But I guess
you don't have one here, huh?

225
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,166
Maybe in Green Cove.

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,466
Now, did you..

227
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,566
Sonny get you settled
in the trailer?

228
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,100
I don't work for him.

229
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,433
Maybe you saw the motor home
behind the clinic.

230
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm afraid it's a little cozy
for a man your size.

231
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,566
It'll be fine.

232
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,333
'A‐And take care when
you open the door.'

233
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:17,566
Or did you get
it grounded, Sonny?

234
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:31,000
Damn!

235
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,133
'Take the baby's temperature
every four hours'

236
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,333
'and call me if..'

237
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,533
'Or see Dr. Benton
at the clinic'

238
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,800
if it doesn't drop
below 100 by tomorrow.

239
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,500
‐ Thank you.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

240
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,233
Busy day?

241
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,033
No, not at all

242
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,300
since half my patients
are coming here.

243
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:22,166
Well, it'll take time for...
some of them to accept you.

244
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,566
No, it won't.

245
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,266
I'm not staying.

246
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,066
'You don't need
a surgeon'

247
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,533
and if you're going
to get any rest

248
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:32,633
you need a doctor
that everyone can... accept.

249
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,200
This isn't just about race.

250
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,400
I don't care
what it's about.

251
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,500
Well, so you only
came for the money?

252
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:42,366
You can get by with a nurse.

253
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,466
Sonny hasn't even got
your car running yet.

254
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,433
That's okay.
I'll find a ride.

255
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,366
So...thanks for the ride.

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,266
Oh, best reason we've had
to go to work all year.

257
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,066
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
when we get to the dock

258
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,166
you make sure every woman
coming on the shift

259
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,500
sees you
getting out our truck.

260
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,400
Ain't that right, Annie?

261
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,200
Your Jake hears about this,
he won't be going out

262
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,733
on no boat no time soon.

263
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:10,666
Ooh, Amen to that.

264
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,300
Now, tell me something.
Now, is you really a doctor?

265
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,600
Yeah.

266
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,400
Well, take a look
at Annie hand there.

267
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,066
Becca, I'm driving.

268
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,033
Go on, girl,
show the man your hand.

269
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:26,200
Mmm. Now, has you ever seen
anything the likes of that?

270
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:28,033
Looks like
a pretty bad infection.

271
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,766
Ah, it's from the shrimps.
They got poisons in their head.

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,333
If I were you,
I'd take some antibiotics.

273
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:34,766
Give it a rest.
Give it time to heal.

274
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,433
Stop working?

275
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,166
Not unless you gonna
stow me back up to Chicago.

276
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,500
I don't know if I could afford
to keep a woman like you.

277
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,800
Ooh!

278
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,550
Hold up, what's that?

279
00:14:02,084 --> 00:14:03,884
What the hell?

280
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,150
'Help!'

281
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:07,317
Help me!

282
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,984
'Help me!'

283
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:10,417
Russell! Help him!

284
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,017
Sir, sir, sir,
lie down, lie down.

285
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,550
‐ I'm a doctor.
‐ Branch caught in the throttle.

286
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:16,017
‐ I couldn't get it out of gear.
‐ Don't move.

287
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,150
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ Don't move.

288
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,384
Russell. My boy.
Find my son.

289
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:20,917
Your son was
on the tractor with you?

290
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,950
‐ In my lap.
‐ Okay. Okay, don't worry.

291
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,484
‐ I'll find him.
‐ He's only four.

292
00:14:24,517 --> 00:14:25,984
He couldn't
have gone far.

293
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,650
Ladies! Over here!

294
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,384
Wha..

295
00:14:41,984 --> 00:14:44,917
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

296
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,517
'I need you to
drive to a phone!'

297
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,584
‐ Was he run over?
‐ Nearest town's five miles.

298
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:51,017
Sir, do you have a phone?

299
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,150
Yes. Next driveway.
My wife's home.

300
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,217
Go! Go! Call an ambulance!

301
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,584
Tell them it's a matter
of life or death!

302
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:00,184
Come on. Come on.

303
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,184
Morning, doctor.

304
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,384
Hey.

305
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:32,617
You staying off that foot?

306
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,584
Soaking it three times a day.

307
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,150
What?

308
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,984
Anybody ever tell you
that smoking will kill you?

309
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,150
Nah. You the first.

310
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,617
Hey, Adelina, you
been shopping?

311
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,050
What it look like?

312
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:58,250
You got something for me?

313
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,550
You know she do, Hubert.

314
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,417
Yeah? A smack
upside your head.

315
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,184
Wait, where you goin'?. You
never showed us what you got.

316
00:16:05,217 --> 00:16:07,250
And I ain't going to.

317
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:10,150
'That girl crazy.'

318
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,184
'You know, I think it's looking
a lot better, Tavius'

319
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:14,284
'and, uh, if you come back
in a couple of days'

320
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,650
I believe we'll be able
to take it off then. Alright?

321
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,250
Did you decide
not to go?

322
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:22,484
You can go
and get some rest.

323
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,484
I'll, uh..
I'll take over.

324
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:30,117
Somebody's waiting
for you. Sally?

325
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,184
I'm Sally Mannon.

326
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,284
We didn't really get a chance
to meet last night.

327
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,150
Oh. I saw you.

328
00:16:36,184 --> 00:16:38,350
She told me about
the tractor accident.

329
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:41,084
So, how's your husband
and son?

330
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:44,117
Fine, thanks to you.

331
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,517
I brought you a pie.

332
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,450
Sweet tater.
I hope you like that.

333
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,350
Sweet potato pie?
Mrs. Mannon, are you kidding?

334
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,684
This is my favorite.
I'm going to dig in right now.

335
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:54,350
'Dr. Benton gave my boy oxygen
all the way to Green Cove.'

336
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:57,050
‐ You bagged him for 80 miles?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

337
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,517
'In the back of a pickup.'

338
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,617
Mmm!

339
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,484
This is delicious.
I'm sorry. Whoo!

340
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:08,184
This is the best thing I've had
since I've been here.

341
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,417
I got to go.

342
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,684
God bless you.

343
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:14,384
Mm‐hmm.

344
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:16,150
Oh...thank you.

345
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,984
You going to
stay, then?

346
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:22,050
It's not that busy.

347
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,084
Well, that's 'cause I make
rounds on Tuesdays.

348
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,484
‐ Rounds?
‐ House calls.

349
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,217
I heard one
of the Ebee girls is pregnant

350
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,917
'and the Ebees live far out.'

351
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,217
I'm sure she hasn't had
any prenatal care.

352
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,117
I haven't done OB since...
med school.

353
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,650
Well, never mind. I'll go.

354
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:42,117
No, no, no. Look,
I'm not saying I won't go.

355
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,517
I'll go
if I can borrow your truck.

356
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,217
Sonny hasn't fixed my car yet.

357
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,017
You can't get there by car.

358
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,684
What y'all want?

359
00:18:10,717 --> 00:18:12,350
I'm Dr. Benton.

360
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,517
Miss Chapman sent me to check
on your daughter.

361
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,217
She don't need checking.

362
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:19,650
That it?

363
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,250
Alright. Hurry up
before your pa gets back.

364
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:25,950
You know how he is.

365
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,384
‐ Alright.
‐ Sir?

366
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,250
Doctor, sir, if you don't mind?

367
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,350
I was feeling faint yesterday.

368
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,084
You want me to examine you?

369
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:37,617
Ma says you can check me
out here.

370
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,017
Believe me..

371
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,450
...you don't want to go in.

372
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:46,084
'Well...I'm concerned
about your blood pressure.'

373
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,917
'It's a little high.'

374
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,084
Have you had any other
problems besides dizziness?

375
00:18:51,117 --> 00:18:54,917
Um... a little bit
of blood came out last week.

376
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:59,517
Well, I'm no
specialist, but, uh..

377
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,217
'I think you should get
an ultrasound and blood tests'

378
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,484
'in Green Cove.'

379
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,217
What's going on?

380
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,584
Uh, papa

381
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:08,584
'Dr. Benton
is looking after me.'

382
00:19:08,617 --> 00:19:11,150
Well, this would be the doctor
for you, wouldn't it?

383
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,250
Sir, your daughter
needs some tests.

384
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:16,217
She don't need nothing from you.

385
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,017
Her blood pressure is elevated.

386
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,984
Melanie Irene, get on inside.

387
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,517
Get this man
off my property.

388
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,550
'Melly's had enough help
from his kind already.'

389
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:33,450
We'll see what the authorities
have to say.

390
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:36,484
Well, you can call the president
as far as I'm concerned.

391
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:39,184
Ain't nobody gonna tell me
how to do for my kid.

392
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,584
R‐e‐e‐s‐e.

393
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,317
Reese..

394
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,117
The knuckles of the "A" hand

395
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,050
rub against one another
in circles.

396
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,284
Wash...

397
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:56,584
'The prone right hand
is drawn...'

398
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,617
'Wash your hands, Reese.'

399
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,584
'Reese, wash your hands.'

400
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:05,417
Mr. Morgan?

401
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,017
Oh, morning, doctor.

402
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,584
I thought I told you
to stay off that foot.

403
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,584
You also told me
to wash it three times a day.

404
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:16,517
Right. So what are you doing
walking on it?

405
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,584
Now, I can't wash my foot
without water, now can I?

406
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,884
Have a good day, doctor.

407
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,117
Your glucose level
is too high.

408
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,950
Now what do you
want it to be?

409
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:35,017
Adelina, answer the doctor.

410
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,450
Between 70 and 120, sir.

411
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:42,017
Mm‐hmm. Now, nurse Maureen
diagnosed you a month ago.

412
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,984
You should have better control
over your diabetes by now.

413
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,484
Have you been checking
your glucose level

414
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,650
three times a day?

415
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,350
Did you check it
the other day

416
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,650
after you drank
that bottle of soda?

417
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:53,050
Adelina!

418
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,584
I only took a sip.

419
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:56,684
That's one sip
too many, okay?

420
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,684
If she doesn't keep
her glucose level

421
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,017
under control, she could damage
her kidneys and her heart

422
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,584
'not to mention
going blind.'

423
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:04,450
She could have another seizure
like she had last month.

424
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,684
Well, it was my fault
for not bringing her in.

425
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:08,517
I don't think
too highly of doctors

426
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,184
since we lost Adelina's mama.

427
00:21:11,217 --> 00:21:12,917
Alright.

428
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,917
Alright. So, you going to show
me how to inject this?

429
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,017
No, sir.

430
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,250
Alright. Well, I'll show you.

431
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,984
Been shopping?

432
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:35,517
Yeah. Thought I'd cook

433
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,217
some vegetables tonight,
if you don't mind.

434
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,650
Be fine.

435
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,950
How'd the clinic go?

436
00:21:41,984 --> 00:21:45,550
Adelina Young came in
with a glucose level of 280.

437
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:47,317
Her grandmother claims
they haven't gotten

438
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,317
a supply of insulin
or glucose strips.

439
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,084
Oh, Lord.

440
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:53,250
The grandmother doesn't
understand the routine.

441
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:55,017
Adelina should've been
admitted to a hospital

442
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,250
for diabetic teaching.

443
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:57,984
Well, that's not gonna happen.

444
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,417
Or try a Subq insulin pump.
Have you heard of those?

445
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,150
Something newer than leeches?

446
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,617
Look..

447
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,450
...I'm just trying to raise
the standard of care here.

448
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:11,184
We should expect a 100%.

449
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:15,217
I do, but I've learned
to settle for 60%.

450
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,917
60% is failure.

451
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,650
‐ It takes time for people‐‐
‐ They've had a month.

452
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:21,350
Adelina is an athlete
and she's probably

453
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:22,950
scared to death that this is
gonna end all that.

454
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,484
Well, she could go
into a diabetic coma.

455
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:25,684
Don't you think I know that?

456
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,250
I‐I don't know
what you know.

457
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:30,317
'Maureen.'

458
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,050
Maureen, you gotta come.

459
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,250
Something's wrong
with Melanie.

460
00:22:34,284 --> 00:22:35,617
She's been
a laborin' and..

461
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,650
Well, the baby
won't come.

462
00:22:36,684 --> 00:22:38,017
Um, Dr. Benton.

463
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,617
N‐No, I want you, Maureen.

464
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,184
'Well, you're a damn
fool, Eli.'

465
00:22:41,217 --> 00:22:42,517
'I can't
move that fast.'

466
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,484
'Just think
of Melanie.'

467
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:45,617
Well, come on.

468
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:58,417
Oh, sweet Jesus!

469
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,384
‐ I need more light!
‐ The generator's busted.

470
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:03,050
You get on outside.
Come on!

471
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,217
Oh, mama, help me!

472
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,317
Okay, okay. Melanie, Melanie,
I need you to relax, okay?

473
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,684
I know, I know.
Come on.

474
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:11,050
I don't think the head
is engaged.

475
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:15,317
Ah, damn it. I feel the foot.

476
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,917
What does that mean?

477
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,050
The baby's upside down.

478
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,550
Well, what the hell
are you doing?

479
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:21,284
I'm looking up how
to deliver this baby.

480
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,950
‐ What, you don't know how?
‐ Look, I'm a surgeon.

481
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,617
Not an OB. Do you have
any flashlights?

482
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,550
‐ Couple of battery lanterns.
‐ Well, go, go, go, get them.

483
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,350
And somebody blow out all
of these candles.

484
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,317
I'm gonna use ether
if I can find it.

485
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,617
'Hey, Melanie, I need
you to breathe nice and easy.'

486
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,684
'I can't.'

487
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:35,250
You're gonna
have to try.

488
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,450
Well, what the hell
are you doing to her?

489
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,184
She has to be sedated.

490
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,317
If her uterus ruptures,
it could kill her.

491
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,484
Yeah, well,
I might kill her

492
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:41,517
myself once I see
the bastard.

493
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,950
You hush.

494
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,450
Mrs. Ebee, I need
you to hold this bottle

495
00:23:44,484 --> 00:23:46,150
over Melanie's face
letting it drip slowly

496
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,584
into the mask,
just like this, okay?

497
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:49,250
‐ Alright.
‐ She brought this on herself.

498
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:51,017
Well, okay, Mr. Ebee,
can you read?

499
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,950
‐ Of course I can.
‐ Okay, good. Go.

500
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:55,250
I need you to read off this
computer screen right now.

501
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:01,417
You do it, mama.

502
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:12,450
"Insert, uh,
the right hand

503
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,917
into the ker‐ker.."

504
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,217
Cervix, cervix.
Okay, that's it.

505
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,050
'Come on. Go on.'

506
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,250
"Push the head

507
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:25,484
"and with the left
hand external

508
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:28,284
bring the rump down.."

509
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,017
‐ Rump.
‐ Hold it. Stop.

510
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,684
Okay, okay. Go on.

511
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:37,950
Uh, "lift the feet up

512
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,150
'"and push the head'

513
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:41,684
"over the pel..

514
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,017
...pelvis rim."

515
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,217
Oh, damn it.

516
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,117
Alright.
Oh, come on.

517
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:50,317
Come on.

518
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,184
Alright.

519
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:00,217
I got one foot out.

520
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,117
Alright.

521
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:07,350
Alright. There's the other one.

522
00:25:12,084 --> 00:25:13,950
Ah, damn it.
The head's stuck.

523
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,550
Oh, please, Jesus.

524
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:18,384
Okay, okay, okay.
Come on, come on.

525
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,250
Alright, alright.
We're almost near.

526
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,884
Alright.
Okay, stop the drip.

527
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,217
Hey.

528
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:39,517
Okay, you got a granddaughter.

529
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,017
Oh, she looks just like an Ebee.
See, Eli?

530
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,150
I see.

531
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:55,917
Melanie's damn lucky.

532
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,284
How're you feeling?

533
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,117
Happy.

534
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,417
Is my baby okay?

535
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,117
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's fine.

536
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:19,317
You know, from what
your father said

537
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,217
I have to ask,
is there any chance

538
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,050
that the father
of this baby is black?

539
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,084
You see her baby.
She's white.

540
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,217
Yeah, I know.

541
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,117
Just so that you know

542
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,550
a lot of
African American babies

543
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:32,684
don't get their
full pigmentation

544
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,950
until a few days later.

545
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,484
So if there's any chance
of that happening

546
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:39,450
for your baby's safety
and for yours, you..

547
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,317
...you need
to let me know, okay?

548
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,450
'I got worried.'

549
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,084
It was a breech.

550
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:56,517
Mother and baby
are fine, but..

551
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,017
I'm gonna have take
'em back to Laverne.

552
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,150
Not in my boat.

553
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,350
Hey, doc.

554
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:05,084
Don't take off
just yet.

555
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,117
Here.

556
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:11,117
There's no charge.

557
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,917
Maureen?

558
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,117
Much obliged, Eli.

559
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:24,450
Now, that took a lot
for him to offer to pay you.

560
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:26,684
I don't want his money.
The baby's jaundiced.

561
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:29,050
I hope she and the mom can stay
at your house for a few days?

562
00:27:29,084 --> 00:27:30,517
Jaundice usually goes away.

563
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,350
No.

564
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,017
Explain to the Ebees
that the mother

565
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,384
and baby have
to be taken in.

566
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:01,870
How you doin'?

567
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:04,503
I don't wanna talk about it.

568
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:08,837
Good.

569
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,237
I didn't come
here to talk.

570
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,570
Come on.

571
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,637
Morning, doctor.

572
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,403
Hey, how you doin',
Mr. Morgan?

573
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:11,703
Did you drop that big jug
of water off on my porch?

574
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:12,837
Yeah.

575
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,737
I sure want
to thank you.

576
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,270
But I had to come
to town anyway.

577
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:19,170
If I don't sit
in this chair

578
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:20,303
who's gonna do it?

579
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:22,437
'Come on.'

580
00:29:28,537 --> 00:29:30,403
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

581
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,703
You're on your
feet again.

582
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,703
Well, I only got your help
for a few more days.

583
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:37,370
I thought maybe we
could hold down the fort here

584
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,770
and send you to pick up
from the pharmacy.

585
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:41,437
How's the baby?

586
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,937
Her jaundice doesn't
appear any worse.

587
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,570
Melanie's itching to go home.

588
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:49,570
Sonny, why don't you
go get Dr. Benton his keys.

589
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,370
You know, it's only been
three days.

590
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,270
If the baby's pigment
was gonna darken

591
00:29:56,303 --> 00:29:57,503
it would have started.

592
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:03,903
Probably.

593
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,870
That was smart
the way you handled Ebee.

594
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:09,170
You know, you may
have a flair

595
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:10,870
for country medicine
after all.

596
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,503
I don't think so.

597
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,403
Oh, I don't either.

598
00:30:18,437 --> 00:30:20,637
Look, I really don't
feel like driving 80 miles.

599
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,803
Adelina and her grandma
are willing to keep you company.

600
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:26,837
The grandmother says
she doesn't trust hospitals.

601
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,803
Well, she must be sweet
on to you.

602
00:30:29,837 --> 00:30:33,803
And I heard, they have
the videophone hooked up.

603
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,937
Might could see your son.

604
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:52,937
Dr. Benton said
the pump is better.

605
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,337
'And I sure, I'll consider
putting you on one'

606
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,837
'if you learn to control
your glucose level'

607
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,270
'by the time
we get 'em.'

608
00:30:58,303 --> 00:31:00,437
How's that?

609
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,870
I'm a little more
concerned about, uh

610
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,937
another finding that
we got here, little, uh..

611
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,303
Dr. Benton, did you detect
a pansystolic murmur

612
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:07,403
when you examined Adelina?

613
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:09,903
‐ A murmur?
‐ Oh, yes, sir.

614
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:11,637
'And I listened
to her chest'

615
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,570
I thought I appreciated
a slight murmur

616
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:15,503
along the left
sternal border.

617
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,670
The echo
shows a VSD.

618
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,370
What's that?

619
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:21,937
No, I didn't listen
to her chest.

620
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,837
She's was in
for diabetes monitoring.

621
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,637
What's wrong?

622
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,437
Adelina has a small hole
in her heart.

623
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,937
A hole?

624
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,203
‐ From the diabetes?
‐ 'No, ma'am, it's unrelated.'

625
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,703
'She's probably had
it since birth.'

626
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,237
Uh‐huh.

627
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,203
She, uh, she should just
get it repaired

628
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:38,570
before it
gets any worse.

629
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,770
Excuse me.

630
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,837
What does he mean
by repaired?

631
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,503
It's a simple surgery.

632
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,703
I'm having surgery?

633
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:49,337
I don't want her cut.

634
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,303
You never said
I needed surgery.

635
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,870
I missed it.

636
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:58,437
Dr. Benton, call's ready.

637
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,437
Excuse me, please.

638
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,337
'Come on, Reese.'

639
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,770
'Who're you laughing at?'

640
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:10,370
Reese, come on.
Come on, man, wash your hands.

641
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:11,703
'Excuse me.
That's it for today.'

642
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:13,570
‐ Okay.
‐ 'Oh.'

643
00:32:13,603 --> 00:32:15,703
Uh, they're actually saying
that we've got to go now.

644
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,803
Oh, thanks, Elizabeth.
Um, just four more days to go.

645
00:32:18,837 --> 00:32:21,303
‐ 'Alright.'
‐ I'll be home on Friday.

646
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:22,870
He'll be thrilled to see you.

647
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,937
Okay. Okay, Reese, okay,
I got to go.

648
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,270
Bye‐bye.

649
00:32:26,303 --> 00:32:28,470
Bye‐bye. Come on, Reese.
Say bye‐bye.

650
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,237
You goin' home this Friday?

651
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,337
Well, uh,
yeah, uh, but

652
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,703
Dr. Brooks will find
you a good surgeon.

653
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:41,737
And what else is he
gonna find wrong with her?

654
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,937
Miss Deane, I know it's hard
to plan ahead sometimes

655
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,237
but if we could just set a date,
then it would give us some‐‐

656
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,937
I'll think it over.

657
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,403
Yes, ma'am,
I'm sure you will.

658
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,603
You really shouldn't
put this thing off.

659
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,703
What was wrong
with next week?

660
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,203
I have to think about it.

661
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,537
But you will call
Dr. Brookes, right?

662
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,670
As soon as I can.

663
00:33:02,937 --> 00:33:04,303
Well, that took a while.

664
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:05,803
Ignorance, you know,
it's just ignorance.

665
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:07,437
There's no reason why
a kid in this century

666
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,303
couldn't have
that surgery..

667
00:33:09,337 --> 00:33:11,437
What happened?

668
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,370
‐ They found Jesse dead.
‐ Oh, man.

669
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,637
In front of Suggs' store
about an hour after you left.

670
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,170
What was it an MI? I mean,
why didn't you page me?

671
00:33:18,203 --> 00:33:19,603
'Well, It could have been
his heart.'

672
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:21,170
'It could have been
a stroke..'

673
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:22,903
Or an embolism.

674
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,337
'I mean, he said his leg ached.
And I..'

675
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,770
...I should
have checked him out.

676
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:29,537
He was an old man,
Dr. Benton.

677
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,203
There was nothing we could do.

678
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:34,703
God rest his soul.

679
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:35,803
'Funeral's Friday.'

680
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:37,837
I've been saying

681
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,170
Jesse wanted to
lay with his wife

682
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:43,803
in our churchyard
but he born a catholic

683
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:47,237
and I know he'd want the sister
to offer a prayer.

684
00:33:47,837 --> 00:33:49,137
What sister?

685
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:53,870
May the angels lead you
into paradise

686
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,903
and may the martyrs
come to welcome you

687
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,470
and take you
to the holy city.

688
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:02,237
The new and eternal Jerusalem

689
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,303
and may the choir of angels
welcome you

690
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,303
where Lazarus
is poor no longer.

691
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,203
May you have eternal rest.

692
00:34:12,203 --> 00:34:15,903
Eternal rest grant
unto him, oh, Lord.

693
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,670
'And let perpetual life
shine upon him.'

694
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,670
'And may he rest
in peace.'

695
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,903
Goodbye, Jesse.

696
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,570
Amen.

697
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:34,770
Amen.

698
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:41,937
You is a liar,
you do not.

699
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,537
I do too.

700
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,703
You just stick it
and push the insulin.

701
00:34:45,737 --> 00:34:47,537
That's right.

702
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,403
Adelina thinks maybe she gonna
be a doctor herself one day.

703
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:51,503
Hubert.

704
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:52,603
That's what you said.

705
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:53,803
So, what's wrong
with that?

706
00:34:53,837 --> 00:34:55,870
Adelina will make
a fine doctor.

707
00:34:55,903 --> 00:34:57,270
I changed my mind.

708
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,837
Oh, yeah, why is that?

709
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,170
'Cause doctors act like

710
00:35:01,203 --> 00:35:02,637
they know everything
when they don't.

711
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:05,303
Yep.

712
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,537
We make mistakes.

713
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,303
I made a mistake
with your diagnosis.

714
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:12,537
But I learned something.

715
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:14,837
It's because of you.

716
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:18,737
I am sorry, Adelina.

717
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,170
That's okay.

718
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:29,303
That is for me?

719
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,637
If you're thinking of arguing
with grandma Deane

720
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,503
I'd save my breath.

721
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,546
Adelina needs
that surgery.

722
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,113
I just can't leave.

723
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,346
Well, I'll work on her.

724
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:41,313
She'll come around.

725
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,380
‐ Finish packing?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

726
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,480
I appreciate your
sticking it out here.

727
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,313
I didn't do anything.

728
00:35:50,346 --> 00:35:52,080
What?

729
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:56,080
Well, maybe not by
Chicago surgeon standards

730
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,113
but you took good
care of Laverne.

731
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,313
I love this town.

732
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:06,080
I guess that's hard
for you to understand.

733
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:07,180
Yeah, well, I'm not
the missionary type, you know?

734
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:08,513
No!

735
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,646
And I never did well with
a doctor over my shoulder.

736
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:15,213
This is a good
place for a nun

737
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:17,013
with authority issues.

738
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,513
What's your specialty
gonna be?

739
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,746
I bet you got
that figured out.

740
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,013
Yep.

741
00:36:24,046 --> 00:36:25,213
Five years ago I decided

742
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:27,380
to go into cardiothoracic.

743
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:28,680
Well, no wonder
it stung you

744
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:30,213
to miss that
heart murmur.

745
00:36:31,413 --> 00:36:32,446
Well, I missed it too.

746
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,746
Yeah, but you're
a nurse.

747
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,680
Look out, now.

748
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,613
I don't know, this last year,
I've been, uh..

749
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:41,680
I don't know, I've been
distracted, you know

750
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,146
with my son and all.

751
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,746
Well, it's not easy
raising a child.

752
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,013
Yeah, well,
you would know that.

753
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:50,313
Oh, I've just had Sonny
the last few years.

754
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:54,346
I took him in
when his folks died and..

755
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,580
Being a parent's
a full‐time job.

756
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:02,246
Yeah, it's hard work, but..

757
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,213
...I love being with my son.

758
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,013
Oh, man.

759
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:09,180
Well, being with people.

760
00:37:09,213 --> 00:37:10,613
It's as simple as that,
isn't it?

761
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,213
And what a blessing
when you..

762
00:37:15,713 --> 00:37:18,180
...can hear the sound
of your own heart.

763
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,313
Hey, shrimp boat blew
down at south port.

764
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:23,446
How many hurt?

765
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,513
‐ I'm a doctor. How bad?
‐ 'They sank their boat.'

766
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:36,680
Radioed us one guy got blown
through the roof.

767
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,246
Shrimp boat bringing
them in

768
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
had to fish another guy
out of the water.

769
00:37:39,313 --> 00:37:40,746
Why're they just
sittin' here?

770
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,313
'Have to raise the outriggers
supporting dock.'

771
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:43,680
‐ How long does that take?
‐ 15 minutes.

772
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:45,146
That's too long.
Can you get me out there?

773
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,280
High up. Kenny's boat's
right here.

774
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:49,113
Doctor needs to get out
to the Gulf Prince.

775
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:52,213
Maureen, round up a first aid
kit and some fresh water.

776
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,080
‐ You got it.
‐ Go, go.

777
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:06,546
Alright, here we go.
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

778
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,313
Maureen, we got two guys
injured pretty bad.

779
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,180
This one has a flail chest
with evisceration.

780
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:11,246
'Other one has a partial
amputation'

781
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,646
'of the upper right thigh.'

782
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,080
We got bottled water
and two first aid kits.

783
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:17,131
Well, let's lay them down
over here.

784
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:19,598
Crazy fools didn't secure
their propane tank.

785
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,298
Rolled down
into the engine room

786
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,098
hit the clutch on the boiler,
whole boat blew.

787
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:26,464
If I can stabilize the chest
wall, he may be able to breathe.

788
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:28,197
'Come on, come on, don't
die on me.'

789
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,831
I need somebody to go and find
the smallest fishing fly

790
00:38:29,864 --> 00:38:31,397
you can find and some leader.

791
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:33,764
Does anyone have any pliers
for taking out fish hooks?

792
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:35,197
Got a needle nose
in my tackle box.

793
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,397
Alright, go, go!
Sonny, are you with me?

794
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,931
‐ Yes.
‐ 'Listen to me.'

795
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:39,731
This man is gonna die
without your help.

796
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:41,231
I need you to find some
saran wrap and plenty of this.

797
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:42,897
‐ Saran wrap?
‐ That's right.

798
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:43,964
‐ What is that over there?
‐ Uh, shrimp factory.

799
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:45,664
Alright, try them. Go, move!

800
00:38:45,697 --> 00:38:47,097
‐ Where is that ice?
‐ I got some flies.

801
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,131
‐ And fishing leader here.
‐ Open up.

802
00:38:48,164 --> 00:38:49,297
Okay, take that small one.

803
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:50,864
You peel all the fur
and feathers off.

804
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:52,197
I want you to thread
it with the leader

805
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:53,664
and then run some
alcohol over that.

806
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,164
I need some alcohol
from the first aid kit.

807
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:57,397
‐ Maureen, how you doing?
‐ 'This leg's skin is ischemic.'

808
00:38:57,431 --> 00:38:59,864
He's gonna loose it if we
don't get this tourniquet off.

809
00:38:59,897 --> 00:39:01,397
‐ This ice ain't that clean.
‐ 'It'll do.'

810
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:03,197
Let's just pack
it around his leg.

811
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:07,364
‐ How's yours holding up?
‐ I got a faint pulse.

812
00:39:07,397 --> 00:39:08,731
'Thank god for small miracles.'

813
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:09,864
Where the hell
is Sonny?

814
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,764
They wouldn't give it to me
so I had to steal it.

815
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,164
Now, listen to me
carefully, alright?

816
00:39:15,197 --> 00:39:16,931
I'm depending on you.
Come on, over here.

817
00:39:16,964 --> 00:39:18,997
I'm going to stabilize his chest
with the saran wrap.

818
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:20,664
I want you to wrap it
around him, alright?

819
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:23,264
Here we go, boys, here we go.
Roll him, roll him.

820
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:25,664
Lift him. Lift him up.
Here we go.

821
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,731
Let's go.

822
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:30,231
Maureen! You got any
gauze or bandages over there?

823
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,764
I used it up on this fella.

824
00:39:31,797 --> 00:39:33,864
I need something to hold
this guy's guts in with.

825
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:35,064
'How about my T‐shirt?'

826
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,064
Yeah, fine. Take it off.
Here, take this.

827
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:39,197
Alright, here we go.
Sonny, you just stay here.

828
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:40,231
Here, give me your hand.
Put it right there.

829
00:39:40,264 --> 00:39:41,864
Now, you feel his pulse?

830
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,397
Now, as long as you can feel
a pulse, he is alive.

831
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:45,197
If it stops,
you let me know, alright?

832
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:47,297
‐ Needle's threaded, doc.
‐ Alright, you ready?

833
00:39:47,331 --> 00:39:49,364
Come on, come on, come on.

834
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:51,831
I'm gonna tie off
the superficial femoral artery

835
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,831
to stop the bleeding.

836
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:56,164
Alright, now,
release the tourniquet slowly

837
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:58,997
'so I can isolate the artery
and clean out any clots.'

838
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,097
Ah, ah, ah. Okay.

839
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,797
Okay, now, tighten
the tourniquet.

840
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:03,931
Here we go.

841
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:06,964
How we doing there, Sonny?

842
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:09,664
Uh, he's breathing.
Still has a pulse.

843
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:10,664
Good.

844
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:13,097
Good. Come on, cut.

845
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,197
Good.

846
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:26,764
Nice work, Dr. Benton.

847
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:28,097
Yeah.

848
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:29,997
You, too.

849
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:38,097
Guess I'll try
to borrow a shirt.

850
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,731
Sonny, you did
good today, man.

851
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:53,297
We were mighty lucky
there was a surgeon in town.

852
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:56,331
And I'm sorry you missed
your flight.

853
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,264
Yeah, well, I'll
catch one tomorrow.

854
00:41:18,064 --> 00:41:19,864
You're leaving so early?

855
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:21,764
Yeah. I got to take care
of something.

856
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:49,831
'Hey, you're back.'

857
00:42:51,064 --> 00:42:53,064
So, uh, how was it?

858
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:54,364
Different.

859
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:56,131
Congratulations.

860
00:42:56,164 --> 00:42:58,364
Robert Romano told me
that you're a shoo‐in

861
00:42:58,397 --> 00:43:00,664
'for a cardiothoracic
spot next year.'

862
00:43:00,697 --> 00:43:02,764
Yeah, well, you know
cardiothoracic is a pretty

863
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,031
time‐consuming specialty.

864
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:06,664
I have a son, you know.

865
00:43:06,697 --> 00:43:08,731
Hey, what are you doing
up here, anyway?

866
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:10,897
I'm, um, I'm visiting Jeanie.

867
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:21,764
Hey, Jeanie.

868
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:22,897
Peter, hey.

869
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:26,297
So, how was the
middle of nowhere?

870
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,297
Wasn't bad. I‐I didn't run
into your family, though.

871
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:31,231
Oh, well.

872
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:36,431
So, uh..

873
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,797
Had a setback, huh?

874
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:43,664
Yeah.
Th‐The plasma will help.

875
00:43:43,697 --> 00:43:44,797
Damn it.

876
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:49,064
Th.. Peter, don't touch me.
For god's sake.

877
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:50,797
I'm a poison.

878
00:44:01,997 --> 00:44:03,131
I can't do this.

879
00:44:06,064 --> 00:44:07,164
I can't.

880
00:44:09,097 --> 00:44:10,664
You can't do this alone.

881
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:17,697
'Hmm?'

882
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,064
Hmm?

883
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:22,997
Yeah.

884
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:26,664
Okay.
