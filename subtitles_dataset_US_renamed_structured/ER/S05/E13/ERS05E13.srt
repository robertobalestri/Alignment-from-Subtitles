1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,333
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:10,033
I've been having
a problem with Dr. Romano.

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,766
Why didn't the genetics clinic
suggest this medication?

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Well, it's brand‐new. It's still
part of a clinical trial.

5
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:16,733
'Do I need to fill
any of this out?'

6
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:20,200
Hmm, I wouldn't bother. He's not
a candidate for the study.

7
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,400
Breaking research protocol could
damage the hospital's funding.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,100
So you, uh, you agree with them?

9
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,166
Yeah, I‐I see their point.

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,533
Doug, don't walk away.

11
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,466
Doug!

12
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,566
Hey, Jerry,
have you seen Doug?

13
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,033
Yeah, he dropped off
some charts.

14
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:41,500
Said he was going
up top for coffee.

15
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,666
‐ Up top?
‐ As in keep your coat on.

16
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,433
I missed you this morning.

17
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,700
I tried not to wake you.

18
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,200
Figured at least
one of us should get

19
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,166
more than four hours of sleep.

20
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,733
I love you.
You know that?

21
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, I do.

22
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,066
Doug, what's going on?
You alright?

23
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,366
Well, I'm not thinking
about jumping

24
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,700
if that's what you're afraid of.

25
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,200
Well, that's good, 'cause
I'm attached to you

26
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,533
so you'd have to
take me with you.

27
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:23,300
It's just...all this,
just about helping a kid.

28
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,333
All what?

29
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,500
You and me getting into it.

30
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:28,033
Hey, that's over and done.

31
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:29,566
It's not over and done
for Mark and Kerry.

32
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
Now, you don't know that.

33
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:32,633
They both already said
they don't want to make

34
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,666
a big deal out of this.

35
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,766
They have to do something.

36
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,466
Why?

37
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
To prove that
they never wanted

38
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,500
a pediatric attending
in the first place.

39
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,200
Doug.

40
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:47,233
‐ Alright. But that's not fair.
‐ No.

41
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,066
Hey..

42
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,200
...you put the patient first.

43
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,400
And that's what we're
supposed to do, isn't it?

44
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,400
Huh?

45
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,233
You're good to me,
you know that?

46
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,233
Yeah, I know that.

47
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,600
Largely, it's been innuendo.

48
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,433
The slightly
inappropriate phrase

49
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,533
at the slightly
inappropriate moment.

50
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,633
'I'm not sure you'd even
consider it sexual harassment.'

51
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,700
Well, if you could
give me some specifics.

52
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:20,233
Oh, one of the more ridiculous
ones was when he spoke of

53
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,533
'sniffing my tailpipe.'

54
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,200
Excuse me?

55
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,566
Oh, I had just parked

56
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
and, uh, he said words
to the effect that

57
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:33,266
had he known it was my car he
would have sniffed my tailpipe.

58
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,800
And I asked him what
he was talking about.

59
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,566
He said something like, uh,
"Oh, I thought we were"

60
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,066
"talking about sex."

61
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,366
‐ But you weren't.
‐ No, of course not.

62
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,333
I was coming in to do
a gastroplasty.

63
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,766
Did Dr. Romano
ever give you any reason

64
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,733
'for terminating
your fellowship?'

65
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,400
Um, I was led to believe that

66
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,433
he didn't have
to give me a reason.

67
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:59,566
But he didn't
sponsor anyone else

68
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,733
and the funding didn't go away.

69
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,300
Nope.

70
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,266
So why do you think he did it?

71
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,800
Well, I suppose he could
have been punishing me.

72
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:12,233
Um...we went out
to lunch once.

73
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,700
Uh...he laid his
heart on his sleeve.

74
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,633
He told me he found me
very attractive

75
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,566
and, uh, asked if we might
go out together on a date.

76
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,100
Mm‐hmm, and how long after that
did the fellowship end?

77
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:27,233
A matter of weeks. Um..

78
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:30,066
But we don't know for certain
if the two are related, do we?

79
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,633
Well, that will be
for others to decide.

80
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,800
What others?

81
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:36,333
If a full investigation
goes forward.

82
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,566
And how will that be determined?

83
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,500
Dr. Weaver, Dr. Corday.

84
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,633
'I just ordered up the
high‐cholesterol breakfast.'

85
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,466
Three eggs, pigs in a blanket
and biscuits and gravy.

86
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,533
May I join you?

87
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,100
Unfortunately,
we just finished.

88
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,366
Yep. Drains to pull,
that sort of thing.

89
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,500
Well, then I guess I'll have
to administer CPR to myself.

90
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,533
‐ Doctors..
‐ Yep.

91
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,566
I've been sitting
for three days.

92
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,500
I would rather walk
if you don't mind.

93
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:04,600
Well, I'd rather you sit, ma'am.
We're going right in here.

94
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:07,333
Carol, I got us a customer.
SOB, with a cough.

95
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:08,766
Who are you calling,
"a son of a bitch?"

96
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,400
No, ma'am I just mean,
"shortness of breath."

97
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,366
Okay, let's get you
seated on the gurney

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
and take off this coat.

99
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:17,266
No, no. It's cold in here.

100
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,433
Oh, we'll promise to give you
the coat back when you leave.

101
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,033
‐ Just give me some medicine.
‐ You need to help us out.

102
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,800
Oh, Sparky.
Get back up here.

103
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,766
You're not allowed
animals in here.

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,166
Give me cough medicine
and I'll get out of your way.

105
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,666
Uh, tell you what.

106
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
Um, why don't you let Malik
take care of Sparky

107
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:35,633
while I quickly
examine you, okay?

108
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:39,600
‐ Are you a dog person?
‐ Yeah. Sure.

109
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,233
'Okay. Any fever?'

110
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,100
‐ Hey, Sparky.
‐ No.

111
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,066
Coughing up any yellow
or green sputum?

112
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,366
No.

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,200
Alright, this might
be a little cold.

114
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay.

115
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,700
I hear a few crackles.

116
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:55,166
'I'd like to get a chest X‐ray.'

117
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,800
'Make sure you don't
have pneumonia.'

118
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,500
'Alice, you're a smoker?'

119
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:02,033
Yeah. Breaks up the boredom
out there on the road.

120
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,266
I just drove straight
from Albuquerque.

121
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,466
Why?

122
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,033
I don't know.

123
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,466
If I'd known it was
this cold in Chicago

124
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,066
I would have gone
straight to Miami.

125
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,666
'How much is this
x‐ray going to cost?'

126
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,566
I don't have the insurance.
I don't have the money.

127
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,300
Alice, we're a county hospital.

128
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,466
If you can't pay,
it's subsidized.

129
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,633
You have any family in Chicago

130
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,033
you'd like us to call for you?

131
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,600
I don't know a soul in Chicago.

132
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,633
Okay, uh, you stay right here,
keep an eye on Sparky

133
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,066
and Malik and I'll
be right back.

134
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,233
‐ I'll order a portable X‐ray.
‐ Good idea.

135
00:10:29,266 --> 00:10:31,400
I don't think radiology's gonna
want to deal with Sparky.

136
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:35,800
Carol, medical records just sent
these charts up for review.

137
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,533
Yeah, we sent them last week.

138
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,133
Then why'd they come back?

139
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,566
It's like they said,
for review by the interim chief.

140
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,433
‐ Uh.
‐ That's you again, right?

141
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,400
Thank you for straightening
that out, Malik.

142
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,466
Ugh!

143
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,133
Richard Tuggle, 35.

144
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,366
Complains of 20 minutes of
heavy, substernal chest pain

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,300
'with nausea and diaphoresis.'

146
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,366
‐ I felt okay this morning.
‐ Coming through!

147
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

148
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,100
It's no problem.
Okay, let's go.

149
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,133
'Here we go.'

150
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,433
BP's 140 over 88, pulse 90.

151
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,400
Chest pain was relieved
by two sprays of nitro.

152
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,433
That's all she wrote.

153
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,466
CBC, chem 20, cardiac enzymes.

154
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,033
Here, help him out of that.

155
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:15,066
And...12 lead.

156
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,233
Have you had pain
like this before?

157
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,400
Never.

158
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,066
‐ Any history of heart disease?
‐ No.

159
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,266
Okay, high blood pressure?
Diabetes?

160
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,033
No. I'm really healthy.

161
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,633
Kerry, when you're free,
Doug's waiting in the lounge.

162
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay, I'll be there in a minute.

163
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,766
Pulse ox is 99 on two liters.

164
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,366
You weren't out
shoveling snow, were you?

165
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,566
No, I work at home.
I'm a telemarketer.

166
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,100
So what is it?
I have a heart attack?

167
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,433
Well, you're a little
young for that.

168
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:40,200
We'll do some blood work and
monitor your heart for a while.

169
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,233
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

170
00:11:42,266 --> 00:11:46,566
‐ I hear an ejection murmur.
‐ Hmm. I hope not.

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,400
Carter?
What are you doing?

172
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:54,600
Ah, Dr. Anspaugh. Meet, uh,
Dudzik, Hiltzik and Strauss.

173
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,066
Second years.
Patient‐doctor class.

174
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,666
Need something?

175
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Well, I was hoping you could
give me some time, but, uh..

176
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,533
...never mind.

177
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:05,800
Where's your student,
Ms. Knight?

178
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,300
Surgery rotation.

179
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,600
Right. Never mind.

180
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,733
Sure you don't want
a cup of coffee?

181
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,166
No, I'm not having
any trouble staying awake.

182
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,133
Okay.

183
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,100
So what's the verdict?

184
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,433
No big verdict.

185
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,700
We agreed that we're
going to keep this quiet

186
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,533
so that we don't jeopardize
hospital funding.

187
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,566
But Mark and I
want some assurance

188
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,433
that this won't happen again.

189
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,433
So anytime you want to prescribe

190
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,733
schedule two narcotics,
morphine, Demerol, Dilaudid

191
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,466
Fentanyl, Methadone, we want
to co‐sign the order.

192
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,566
‐ That's it?
‐ That's it.

193
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,733
Well, if it'll settle things
down, I'll agree to do it.

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,800
You know, whether you
believe me or not

195
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,733
I don't have some compulsion

196
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,133
for breaking the rules.

197
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,133
Sometimes they get in the way
of helping a patient, but..

198
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,166
...if you'd seen how much pain
this kid was in, I think

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
you would've done
the same thing.

200
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,366
Doug, we have seen
that kind of pain.

201
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,366
Dr. Ross, Carol needs
you in curtain three.

202
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Thanks, Jerry.

203
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,266
His contractions
have been so severe.

204
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,066
Worse than anything
I saw with Michael.

205
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,033
And his seizures
have increased.

206
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:57,166
‐ Joi, come sit.
‐ Dr. Julian wants to admit him.

207
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
But I just can't do that.

208
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,666
‐ Roger Julian?
‐ He's a doctor up in genetics.

209
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Yeah, I know him.

210
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,033
Joi spoke to him this morning.

211
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:09,033
Michael, my oldest, was in
the ICU his whole last week

212
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:11,800
hooked up to all those tubes.

213
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,066
I know Ricky doesn't
have much time

214
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,033
but I just can't
do that to him.

215
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:21,433
Can we keep Ricky here?

216
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,133
No, please. I just want
to take him home.

217
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,800
Okay. I'm going
to talk to Roger

218
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,600
but I think we should arrange
for something called a PCA.

219
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,166
Which is
"Patient Controlled Analgesia."

220
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,166
We would hook
Ricky up to an IV

221
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,366
that would deliver pain
medication to him at home.

222
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,433
Now, obviously, you're gonna
have to control it.

223
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:41,533
W‐will it be stronger medicine
than what you gave him before?

224
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:44,066
Dilaudid or Fentanyl.

225
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,133
Okay, I'll do whatever
it takes, Dr. Ross

226
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,400
just so I can keep him at home.

227
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:49,800
I know he..

228
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,400
...probably won't know the
difference, but you know..

229
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,166
'It's okay.'

230
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,466
We'll let you know as soon
as we can set it up, okay?

231
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,666
Okay?

232
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:07,366
Alright. I'll go find Roger.
You set up an IV.

233
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,166
‐ Alright?
‐ Yep.

234
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,133
Getting near the end.

235
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,233
If the survival rate is the same

236
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,633
then why not do the lumpectomy
and save the breast?

237
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,466
Well, because with a modified
radical mastectomy

238
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,133
you can save the patient.

239
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,266
Although a lumpectomy can
get around the tumor.

240
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,633
And then you'd do
radiation therapy, right?

241
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,800
Yeah. And there can
be severe side effects.

242
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,700
Yeah, well that can't be with,
uh, with removing a breast.

243
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:34,366
Hey, look, I'm not discounting
the psychological impact here.

244
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,566
Actually, I think
you are, just a bit.

245
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,266
You'll discover
most male surgeons

246
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,333
find it relatively easy
to just lop off a breast.

247
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:43,400
Elizabeth, come on,
that's cliche. Don't you think?

248
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,466
Yeah, because it's true.

249
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,266
It's a really personal decision
this woman has to make.

250
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,566
She's going to worry about her
sexuality, her self‐image.

251
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Listen, a patient
comes in here with cancer

252
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:55,766
I say, we cut it out.

253
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
See, even there, you
think of her in terms

254
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,566
of being a patient, not
in terms of her being a woman.

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,166
You know what? Uh, it's‐it's,
it's not that complicated.

256
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,733
But you don't want it
to be that complicated.

257
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:09,600
Just cut to the chase,
so to speak.

258
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:12,533
Well, isn't this a scrub fest?

259
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,200
Hey, Peter, you mind if
I borrow your intern?

260
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,433
'I got stuck doing an appy.'

261
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,566
No. Not at all,
I've only got a biopsy.

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,266
‐ Lucy, you're with me.
‐ Thanks. Appreciate it.

263
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,733
You really need my assistance
on an appendectomy?

264
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:26,433
Course not, but I'd
love the company.

265
00:16:26,466 --> 00:16:31,266
‐ So, how was breakfast?
‐ It was coffee, actually.

266
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,566
Women never seem to eat
breakfast anymore, do they?

267
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,066
Now it's just coffee or
sometimes maybe a muffin.

268
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,533
Why is that? They're
worried about their weight?

269
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,500
Or they're worried that
they'll get a reputation

270
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,566
for eating like a horse or..?

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,766
I really couldn't say.

272
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,166
Can you say what
people are talking about

273
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
with Kerry Weaver
over their coffee?

274
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,733
You can stop
playing games, Robert.

275
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:54,400
I know what's going on.
I know someone's accused you.

276
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:56,500
Hmm, falsely.

277
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:59,333
But if someone like Kerry Weaver
starts rooting around

278
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:02,766
and decides she's determined
to dig up something, you know..

279
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,166
‐ That's how people get hurt.
‐ Yep. That's true.

280
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,100
I mean, for instance, uh...
what if, uh, it came out

281
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:13,633
that, uh... you were sleeping
with Peter Benton

282
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,600
while you were his intern
and he was your supervisor

283
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,400
in a position to evaluate you.

284
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,133
Which, I'm sure you're aware,
is a very big "no‐no."

285
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,466
Come on.

286
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,733
Peter and I were together
before I was his intern.

287
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:28,500
Yeah. And you made Anspaugh
aware of that, right?

288
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,300
'Because that's
grounds for dismissal.'

289
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,400
I mean not for you, of course,
but for Peter, Dr. Benton.

290
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,466
Which would be a real shame
considering how much work

291
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,100
he's put into, uh,
getting where he is.

292
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:43,044
You wouldn't dare.

293
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:46,411
I wouldn't like myself very much
if I did that, would I?

294
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:52,611
Anyway, it's not really
in my hands, is it?

295
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:58,144
Yeah, films are back on Alice
Presley and she's antsy to go.

296
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,044
I told her I'd round up
some meat loaf for Sparky.

297
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,478
Thanks, Malik.

298
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:02,578
Hey, Steve.

299
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,778
Nurse Hathaway,
always a pleasure.

300
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,311
I've kept these up
so you can see for yourself.

301
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:09,111
And as you can see
for yourself

302
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:11,144
there is no evidence
of pneumonia.

303
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,211
There is perhaps
a slight increase

304
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,778
in bronchovascular markings.

305
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,344
Which could be smoking‐induced.

306
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:19,611
Although it's more likely
she simply has the flu.

307
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:22,244
Not unlike half the techs
in our department.

308
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:23,444
In other words,
what we have here

309
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,378
is essentially
normal chest film.

310
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,411
I'd like a VQ scan.

311
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,011
What makes
you think she has a PE?

312
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,411
Well, she's a smoker,
she's hypoxic.

313
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,744
She's been
driving for 18 hours

314
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,144
putting her at risk for
blood clots in her legs.

315
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:37,778
‐ What's her heart rate?
‐ Eighty five.

316
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:40,044
‐ Respiratory rate?
‐ Twenty.

317
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,644
‐ Any calf tenderness?
‐ Not really.

318
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:45,311
Well, nothing you've said so far
suggests pulmonary embolus.

319
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:48,078
She has pleuritic chest pain.

320
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:50,544
So does everyone
with bronchitis.

321
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,678
Look, I know there
isn't hard evidence.

322
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,144
It's just a feeling I have.

323
00:18:55,178 --> 00:18:58,311
Well, unfortunately,
I cannot authorize an $800 test

324
00:18:58,344 --> 00:18:59,744
based on your intuition.

325
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:02,211
Your patient has a cough.

326
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:05,178
And no insurance, I might add.

327
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:07,611
So that's what this
is about. Payment?

328
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:10,578
No, although the hospital
does like to cover its expenses.

329
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,344
I'll pay for it.

330
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:19,611
Your checkbook is my command.

331
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:20,711
Thanks, Steve.

332
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,778
One VQ scan...coming up.

333
00:19:23,811 --> 00:19:26,278
Carol, we got a couple
more hackers for you.

334
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:28,178
I'm going to go ahead and stick
them into exam two.

335
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,411
Oh, no, no, no.
I‐it's not ready yet.

336
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:32,078
Yes, it is.
Your patient just left.

337
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:33,611
‐ Alice Presley?
‐ Is she a little nuts?

338
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,378
She was saying about about
going to walk her Sparky.

339
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,478
Oh, God.

340
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,111
So I promised Anspaugh
I'd review charts for him.

341
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,511
Am I a sucker or what?

342
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,578
Hey you know, you don't have
to agree with me.

343
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:45,344
‐ I do.
‐ You okay?

344
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,311
Yes. It's slippery.
But I'm fine.

345
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,544
Good luck, Mark.

346
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:52,044
How's he doing?

347
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:54,678
Oh, pain free,
normal sinus, no ectopy.

348
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:56,278
Which is all good, right?

349
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,044
Yes, but I got some
of your blood work back

350
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:03,111
and I'm concerned because
your cholesterol is 465.

351
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:05,244
‐ That doesn't sound good.
‐ It's not.

352
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,678
Do you have a family history
of high cholesterol?

353
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:10,278
Did your father or
any male relative

354
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:12,378
have, uh, heart
trouble in their thirties?

355
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,244
I don't know.

356
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,778
Because there are inherited
conditions which run in families

357
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,278
and can cause high lipid levels.

358
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:22,378
So you might want to check
because they can put you

359
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:25,111
at risk for a heart attack
at an early age.

360
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:26,778
No, I can't check.
I was adopted.

361
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:30,178
'I don't have a clue
about any medical history.'

362
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,544
I'd like to admit you then

363
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,778
so we can start you on
a cholesterol‐lowering agent

364
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,744
then do a complete workup.

365
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:42,011
Alice, wait. Wait!

366
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,311
You need to stay
for one more test.

367
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,111
I really can't. Miami calls.

368
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:47,511
You don't want to get stuck on
the road and be sick, Alice.

369
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:50,278
You don't understand. I can't
leave the pups out in the cold.

370
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:52,511
It's okay. You can bring Sparky
back in. I won't tell anyone.

371
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,778
No, you really
don't understand.

372
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,744
It's not just Sparky.

373
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,511
I didn't start out
to collect them or anything.

374
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:02,144
It just kind of...happened.

375
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,778
Come on, Jules. We did
our residencies together.

376
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:08,144
Doug, the old school tie
is not going to work.

377
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:11,378
‐ I hated my residency.
‐ There you go. So did I.

378
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,044
Listen, I know Ricky can't
control his analgesic

379
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:14,611
but the mother
says she's willing to do it.

380
00:21:14,644 --> 00:21:18,344
Look, up in genetics, we prefer
to admit these end‐stage kids.

381
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,478
We don't have a lot of
experience with home care.

382
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,111
You do it with
cancer kids all the time.

383
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:23,544
They send them home.
They send them to hospices.

384
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:25,211
Well, maybe oncology
can help you out.

385
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,644
I don't have time to wade
through that department.

386
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,478
This kid's in bad shape.
He needs it.

387
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:31,311
‐ Doug, look‐‐
‐ Jules, come on.

388
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,511
Look, I'll talk to the rest
of the team about it, okay?

389
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,011
We meet...day after tomorrow.
I can let you know then.

390
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:40,011
Ricky doesn't have till
the day after tomorrow.

391
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,111
I'm sorry.

392
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,578
Ouch. You're poking too hard.

393
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,378
Strauss, stop
your whining.

394
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:50,744
These are
the anterior chains

395
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:54,311
and these are
the...posterior.

396
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:56,178
As you examine,
ask yourself

397
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,544
"Do the nodes feel
like BB's

398
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,011
like peas
or sour balls?"

399
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:04,144
‐ I got two BB's.
‐ I got one BB, one sour ball.

400
00:22:04,178 --> 00:22:05,611
Dudzik, quit goofing.

401
00:22:05,644 --> 00:22:06,744
I don't know, it still
doesn't feel like a BB.

402
00:22:06,778 --> 00:22:08,444
It's not a pea.

403
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,544
Ah, it can be tough
to estimate the size at first.

404
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:17,078
BB and a pea, right?

405
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,511
Hmm.

406
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:24,111
Do you have any,
uh...any night sweats?

407
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:25,144
Any weight loss?

408
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,744
Geez, what is this?

409
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,378
Have you?

410
00:22:28,411 --> 00:22:30,244
No. I feel fine.

411
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:32,044
Noticed any enlarged
nodes anywhere else?

412
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,011
Oh, wait a minute.
You're kidding, right?

413
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:35,311
No. Nothing.

414
00:22:35,344 --> 00:22:37,478
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

415
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:40,311
We might get another doctor
to take a look, though.

416
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:41,478
Maybe do a biopsy.

417
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,644
A biopsy?

418
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,411
Hi. Listen, I'm Mark Greene.

419
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:54,478
I'm sorry, I‐I don't
know your name.

420
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,511
Mobalage.

421
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:57,344
Mobalage Ekabo.

422
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:58,411
Listen, you've obviously

423
00:22:58,444 --> 00:22:59,644
done something to your back.

424
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:00,778
Why don't you
let me take a look?

425
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,278
No. Uh..

426
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,278
It's been like this
for a long time.

427
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:05,311
I'm alright.

428
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:06,578
No, it might be a slipped disk.

429
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:08,111
Let me take a look.

430
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,511
Come on.

431
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:17,311
‐ This won't take long.
‐ Yeah?

432
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,711
Sit down right here.

433
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:44,111
So, did you just
start here recently?

434
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:47,711
It's been several months.

435
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,744
Really?

436
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:53,278
Haven't seen you around much.

437
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:58,244
I worked on other floors.

438
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:04,011
Well, we're glad
to have you down here.

439
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,011
Thank you.

440
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:09,644
Just closing the curtain
for a little privacy.

441
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:19,744
Okay.

442
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,744
You can go ahead
and take your shirt off now.

443
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:27,078
No, please.

444
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:28,378
'Stop, please.'

445
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:31,211
No.

446
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:33,711
Stop it, please. No.

447
00:24:33,744 --> 00:24:34,744
'Stop!'

448
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:36,078
I'm not doing anything.

449
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,244
Stop it now!

450
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:39,344
Stop it! Stop it!

451
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,178
‐ It's okay.
‐ Stop it!

452
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,111
Stop it! Alright?

453
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:57,064
Malik, you need
some help?

454
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:58,931
No, I'm cool.
I'm just going in here.

455
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:02,664
Hey, how'd you do?

456
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,797
It's all good, as long as
they like cheese sliders.

457
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,297
Sure we ain't
breaking the rules?

458
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,897
'No, Malik, sneaking
dogs in through windows'

459
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:10,697
and feeding them cheeseburgers
isn't breaking the rules‐‐

460
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:12,297
Did you say
cheeseburgers?

461
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:13,931
That's their favorite.

462
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:17,331
Hey, shut the door.
Shut the door. Please don't ask.

463
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,797
Alright. I need to talk to you
just for a second outside.

464
00:25:19,831 --> 00:25:22,164
Uh...yeah.
Malik, you okay in here?

465
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:23,631
Oh, he's doing great.

466
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:24,831
The pups love him.

467
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:26,764
Alright. I'll be right back.
Shh!

468
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:28,064
Oh, oh, and after they eat

469
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,564
that's usually when
they need to go outside.

470
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,164
Make a little poop.

471
00:25:34,364 --> 00:25:35,997
So, Genetics
bailed on us.

472
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:37,797
I'm not gonna be able to get
a PCA for a couple of days.

473
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:39,931
Well, maybe I can arrange
it through the clinic, you know.

474
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:41,664
I'll call one of the home health
care agencies I've worked with.

475
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:43,964
Ah, it's worth a try.

476
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:46,897
Jerry, did you find out
about that guy Mobalage?

477
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:49,131
No. Ah, Housekeeping
hasn't called back yet.

478
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:50,564
Yeah, I heard about that.
What happened?

479
00:25:50,597 --> 00:25:51,764
He just flipped out.

480
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,164
I hadn't even started
the exam.

481
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,331
Oh, you know, ah, Rachel called
and said she's going

482
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,731
with the purple frames,
whatever that means.

483
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,964
Ah, poor Rachel.

484
00:25:58,997 --> 00:26:00,997
She just found out
that she needs glasses.

485
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,664
She couldn't see
the blackboard at school.

486
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:04,264
Oh, yeah, I hated
when that happened.

487
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,131
I felt like such
an eight‐year‐old geek.

488
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,764
Mmm, happened to me at nine.

489
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:09,331
Same age as Rachel.

490
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:10,731
Fiercely
bad eyesight

491
00:26:10,764 --> 00:26:12,164
on my side
of the family.

492
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,764
Well, you must have
had fiercely red hair

493
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:14,797
on your side
of the family.

494
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,031
Yeah.

495
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,264
And I hope that's
the worst thing

496
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:19,097
that I pass on
from my gene pool.

497
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,297
Whatever, yeah, I mean
it's not like

498
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:21,564
she's gonna go bald.

499
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:22,597
Jerry, weren't you gonna check

500
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,164
those labs for Mrs. Volpe?

501
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,731
Yes, I was. I am.

502
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,864
You owe her, Jerry.

503
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:30,897
Where'd you say Carter is?

504
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:32,064
Suture.

505
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:35,664
ER.

506
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:36,997
Malik, where are you?

507
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,564
Yeah. Okay. I'll be there
to help you in a few minutes.

508
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,164
I got it...on my second call.

509
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:49,664
One of the agencies
I used with PCA

510
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:51,931
on a cancer patient
a few months ago.

511
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:54,031
And Joi's health
insurance will cover it.

512
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,664
Did you tell her about it?

513
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,897
No. I think you'd better
explain it to her.

514
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:00,831
Joi, it looks like
we're going to be able

515
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:03,097
to provide that pain medication
we talked about.

516
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:04,264
Now? Today?

517
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:06,064
Well, a home
health care agency

518
00:27:06,097 --> 00:27:07,964
will deliver the machine
to your house.

519
00:27:07,997 --> 00:27:09,831
M‐machine will be set
to deliver

520
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,831
a specific amount
of, ah, Dilaudid every hour.

521
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,264
When do I push
the button?

522
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:17,231
Whenever you feel
like he's in pain.

523
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:18,764
How do I know
how much to give?

524
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,331
You don't have
to worry about that.

525
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:23,597
There's only one booster dose
within a two‐hour period

526
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:26,031
and then, ah, the machine will
automatically lock out

527
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,631
any additional dose.

528
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:29,564
Dr. Ross is gonna write
you a prescription

529
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,864
and then I'm gonna arrange
for the Medi‐Van

530
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:32,197
to take you and Ricky home.

531
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:33,231
Thank you.

532
00:27:33,264 --> 00:27:34,831
Thank you both so much.

533
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:38,197
Just wish we could do more.

534
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:46,997
Oh, it started
snowing again.

535
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:49,731
Yeah, about
an hour ago.

536
00:27:49,764 --> 00:27:52,097
Listen, Kerry, uh,
I've been thinking

537
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:53,831
and, um, I don't feel

538
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:55,697
comfortable with what I told
you this morning.

539
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:58,197
Well, none of us are really
at ease with the situation.

540
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:00,831
No, no, what I mean to say
is, ah, I don't feel

541
00:28:00,864 --> 00:28:03,264
there was any
harassment involved.

542
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:04,897
Well, that's not our
decision to make.

543
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,797
When the full committee
hears the testimony‐‐

544
00:28:06,831 --> 00:28:08,931
I don't believe
I'll be testifying.

545
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,697
I mean, if I'm not
convinced myself

546
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:12,164
and then I don't feel
I should put it forth

547
00:28:12,197 --> 00:28:14,797
into an official record.

548
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:16,631
Elizabeth, did
something happen today?

549
00:28:16,664 --> 00:28:19,564
No. No, I just don't think
there's any relevance

550
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,597
to the incidents
I mentioned.

551
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:23,297
And, that being the case,
I think it's only

552
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:25,831
right and proper that
I should withdraw my statement.

553
00:28:25,864 --> 00:28:28,664
Look, I'm really sorry.
Sorry that I wasted your time.

554
00:28:28,697 --> 00:28:30,764
Um, I hope you understand.

555
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:43,231
Ready to go in here?

556
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,797
Yep. Labs are all okay.

557
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:49,197
Upon physical exam,
no significant findings

558
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,297
in the head or neck,
other than the enlarged

559
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,031
jugulodigastric node
in the right submaxillary area.

560
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:56,831
Okay. You wanna do
the honors, Carter?

561
00:28:56,864 --> 00:28:59,264
You know, I've actually
never done a neck biopsy.

562
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:02,131
Okay. Well, here's your chance.

563
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:03,964
You ready there, Mr. Strauss?

564
00:29:03,997 --> 00:29:06,097
Yeah. Okay.

565
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:08,864
So, this VQ thing
was positive?

566
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,997
Yes, which means
that small blood clots

567
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:12,931
have traveled
from your legs.

568
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:14,564
And if this condition
isn't treated

569
00:29:14,597 --> 00:29:17,331
a larger blood clot
could lodge in your lung.

570
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:18,897
Yeah, well, that does sound bad.

571
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,597
I'm gonna have to get
myself back here real soon‐‐

572
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:23,697
No, no. Alice, you need
to be admitted today.

573
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,197
And you need to stay
for four or five days

574
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,064
so that your blood can
be properly anticoagulated‐‐

575
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,164
No. My dogs. I can't leave
them on the cold‐‐

576
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:30,931
I know and I don't know
what we're gonna do

577
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,664
but I promise you,
we're gonna think of something.

578
00:29:32,697 --> 00:29:33,697
Okay?

579
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:34,731
Oh, Jerry!

580
00:29:34,764 --> 00:29:35,897
Damn it, Jerry!

581
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:37,597
Go! Go!

582
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:41,631
'Go get them, Jerry! Get them!'

583
00:29:41,664 --> 00:29:42,797
Uh, Oh, God.

584
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:53,631
Hey, Mark, Ricky Abbott,
the kid with‐with ALD.

585
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,264
He's back.
He's in pretty bad shape.

586
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:56,664
I arranged for his mother

587
00:29:56,697 --> 00:29:58,031
to have a home PCA Machine.

588
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,797
I need you to sign off
on the Dilaudid.

589
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,631
He's a genetics
patient, right?

590
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:02,731
That's right,
but he's down here right now.

591
00:30:02,764 --> 00:30:03,964
Yeah, I can't sign off on that.

592
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,764
'He's not on our service.'

593
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,597
I just thought
it would be easier.

594
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,131
Yeah, maybe, but, uh,
that's their deal.

595
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:11,164
You've to go up to genetics

596
00:30:11,197 --> 00:30:12,664
and have them sign off on it.

597
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,197
Yeah, you're right.

598
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,164
Probably should have thought
of that in the first place, huh?

599
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:25,197
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

600
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:26,664
You have
a break out?

601
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:27,931
Yeah, something like that.

602
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,731
Okay, you're on, all set.

603
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,597
Okay, thanks.

604
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,964
I'll give it to her as soon as
I get rid of this little guy.

605
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:38,564
Alright.

606
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:44,797
‐ Jerry‐‐
‐ Sorry, Dr. Greene.

607
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:53,931
Hi.

608
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:56,297
I was looking
for you.

609
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:59,031
Hi.

610
00:30:59,064 --> 00:31:01,631
I am very sorry, um..

611
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:03,664
I can pay for the curtain.

612
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:04,897
I don't care
about the curtain.

613
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,231
I was wondering
if you were okay.

614
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,131
Yeah, I won't cause
any trouble

615
00:31:09,164 --> 00:31:10,931
and, uh, I'd like
to keep my job.

616
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,564
You didn't cause
any trouble

617
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,264
and no one is going
to take your job.

618
00:31:17,164 --> 00:31:19,864
Thank you very much.

619
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:22,564
I do think that you probably
have a pain in your back

620
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:24,964
and I'd like to help
you, if I can.

621
00:31:24,997 --> 00:31:26,997
I think my back is fine. Um..

622
00:31:29,131 --> 00:31:31,164
But there is something.

623
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,164
I'm hoping
you can give it to me.

624
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:35,164
What's that?

625
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,764
I believe it's called Viagra.

626
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:41,231
It's a medication
used for impotence.

627
00:31:41,264 --> 00:31:42,831
I am impotent.

628
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:53,097
‐ Kerry.
‐ Robert, may I sit down?

629
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,164
Ah, certainly.

630
00:31:54,197 --> 00:31:55,831
I'd offer you
something to drink

631
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,264
but we, ah, don't have anything
in the coffee machine‐‐

632
00:31:57,297 --> 00:32:00,864
Did you speak with
Elizabeth Corday today?

633
00:32:00,897 --> 00:32:02,631
She assisted me on an appy.

634
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,097
Is that when you spoke to her

635
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,131
about Maggie Doyle's sexual
harassment inquiry?

636
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:07,597
Why would I do that?

637
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,064
Maybe to stop it
from going forward.

638
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:10,664
I am eager
for it to go ahead.

639
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:12,097
I'm looking forward
to being vindicated.

640
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,197
Oh, well, then you're gonna
be disappointed.

641
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:18,164
Because the investigation's
been closed.

642
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,231
Really? Hmm.

643
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:22,031
Well, I guess we'll
all have to go back

644
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:24,197
to our humdrum lives
then, won't we?

645
00:32:24,231 --> 00:32:27,097
Of course, all the testimony
has been typed up.

646
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:29,664
I've got it in a file.

647
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:34,997
Mm‐hmm.

648
00:32:35,031 --> 00:32:38,064
And‐and the thing
that really sticks out

649
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:41,131
is that bad evaluation
you gave Dr. Doyle.

650
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,597
She's received
such positive remarks

651
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:46,164
on her other rotations.

652
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,764
Hmm, so, you're thinking that
perhaps I was a little bit hasty

653
00:32:49,797 --> 00:32:52,264
and that if I, um, spend
a little more time on it..

654
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,731
Yes, I'm thinking

655
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:57,164
that if you took
that time right now

656
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,197
you might write
something very different.

657
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:02,231
Uh‐huh. Which you'd certainly
be interested in reading.

658
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:04,164
Oh, absolutely.

659
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:06,697
I imagine I'd want
to put it in that file.

660
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:13,264
So, Mobalage,
where are you from?

661
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,664
Nigeria.

662
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:16,164
Ah.

663
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:18,097
That's a ways
away from here.

664
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,731
How do you
like Chicago?

665
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:23,564
Okay.

666
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:25,831
My wife does not like the cold.

667
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,897
She works here
in your cafeteria.

668
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,864
Oh, that must be nice.
Both of you..

669
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,164
Watch my finger..

670
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:35,297
Return to the same place
for work.

671
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:36,997
Mm‐hmm.

672
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:40,164
Okay.
I need to, uh..

673
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:41,297
pull the gown
down now.

674
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:43,231
Alright?

675
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:55,131
Yeah, the, uh, burns seem
to be well‐healed.

676
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,864
Yes. They're not a problem.

677
00:34:04,364 --> 00:34:06,297
Had 'em for a while?

678
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:12,231
Want to tell me
how it happened?

679
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:13,597
No.

680
00:34:20,264 --> 00:34:22,231
I need to examine
below the waist now.

681
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:24,997
I understand.

682
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:37,764
‐ You're in early.
‐ I have no life.

683
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,231
Dr. Weaver,
Sam Broder called back.

684
00:34:40,264 --> 00:34:42,297
Said he would meet you
at Doc Magoo's at 8:00.

685
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:44,031
‐ Thanks, Jerry.
‐ That sounds like a life.

686
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:45,097
Hot date?

687
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:46,331
At Doc Magoo's?

688
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:48,331
Even Dr. Weaver
has her standards.

689
00:34:48,364 --> 00:34:49,897
Thank you, Jerry,
I think.

690
00:34:49,931 --> 00:34:52,131
Dr. Greene,
path report's back

691
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:54,231
on that med
student, Strauss.

692
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:55,964
Well, let him know.

693
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,664
Sent that kid
up to the OR.

694
00:34:57,697 --> 00:34:59,597
‐ Hey, you have a minute?
‐ Yeah.

695
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,231
I wanted to fill you
in on something.

696
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:03,597
Let's go in the lounge.

697
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:04,931
Sure.

698
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:12,264
I need to talk to you
about the pathology report.

699
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,031
You guys mind
hanging outside?

700
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,997
No, they could stay.

701
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,597
I already know it's crappy news.

702
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:24,731
The biopsy shows
Hodgkin's disease.

703
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,564
Which is a form of lymphoma.

704
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:31,764
Oh, man.

705
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,164
You need
to understand, though

706
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:35,797
that it's very treatable

707
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:38,131
with radiation therapy.

708
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:40,697
Your chances of surviving
are extremely high.

709
00:35:44,031 --> 00:35:46,297
Look, can I just, um..

710
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:48,064
...can I just have
a few minutes here, please?

711
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:50,864
Yeah. I'll check back.

712
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,097
Now, I've contacted
a pet rescue group

713
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,964
that can take all
of the dogs tomorrow

714
00:36:00,997 --> 00:36:02,231
but I need each of you
to take two of them home

715
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:03,664
with you tonight.

716
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,631
Uh, I can't do that, Carol.
I‐I have cats.

717
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,764
You have cats?

718
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,164
Yeah, what's wrong with cats?

719
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:09,797
‐ Sorry, Carol.
‐ Alright.

720
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:10,897
Well, I'm a dog person.

721
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:12,697
I'll take two
and one of Jerry's.

722
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,231
I want the little one.

723
00:36:14,264 --> 00:36:16,164
No, no, no, no, no.
Sparky is my man.

724
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:17,731
Hey, Sparky.

725
00:36:17,764 --> 00:36:18,897
I'll take, uh,
two of the big ones.

726
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,564
Al's sick of the little dogs.

727
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,264
‐ What's up with that?
‐ I'll take this Airedale.

728
00:36:22,297 --> 00:36:24,197
‐ If no one wants him.
‐ Okay, great.

729
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:25,997
Carol, Joi Abbott's
on the phone for you.

730
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:28,231
Okay. Uh, listen, work it out
amongst yourselves.

731
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,797
And, uh, just give me two.
Any two, I don't care.

732
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:32,597
Just tie their leashes
to my locker.

733
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:33,931
‐ There you go.
‐ Hey, hey, Spark.

734
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:35,864
Oh, he's so cute.

735
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,697
Hi, Joi. It's Carol Hathaway.

736
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:46,164
Wait, wait. Joi, what's wrong?

737
00:36:47,631 --> 00:36:50,264
Well, well, did they
hook it up?

738
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:52,531
Can you, can you tell
if it's working properly?

739
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:57,831
Oh, Joi, Joi.

740
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,264
You‐you need
to calm down

741
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:00,864
and just take
your time, alright?

742
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:03,097
Just take your time.

743
00:37:03,131 --> 00:37:04,897
Initial lab tests
don't reveal

744
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,231
anything like diabetes

745
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:09,631
which may be related
to erectile dysfunction.

746
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,864
I understand.

747
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,631
You're not on
any medications

748
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,031
that have that
side effect.

749
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,831
No.

750
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,831
And if it was
psychological

751
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:19,697
you could still have
a spontaneous

752
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:22,564
early morning
or mid‐sleep erection.

753
00:37:22,597 --> 00:37:23,864
No, I do not.

754
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:27,564
I think it's caused
by trauma.

755
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,797
If you were
in an accident

756
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,164
or maybe even, uh, beaten..

757
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,631
If your pelvis
had been broken

758
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:42,997
internal bleeding
could have

759
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:45,331
compressed the arteries
and veins

760
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,864
affecting the
blood supply

761
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,197
to and from
the penis.

762
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:52,164
And, uh..

763
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,764
...if that is the case?

764
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:56,064
A urologist would
probably wanna do

765
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:58,631
a vascular
bypass operation

766
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,531
to try to restore
normal function.

767
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:03,797
I think you should
see a urologist.

768
00:38:05,664 --> 00:38:06,664
Okay.

769
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,197
Where's Dr. Romano?

770
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:12,264
Last seen
in the lounge.

771
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:28,764
‐ Was it you?
‐ Sorry?

772
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,131
There are only
a couple of names

773
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:31,664
I gave Dr. Weaver.

774
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:32,997
One didn't have
anything concrete

775
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,731
and the other seems
to have backed out.

776
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:37,731
'Was that you,
Elizabeth?'

777
00:38:37,764 --> 00:38:40,031
'Did you decide to‐to
protect your own place'

778
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:41,164
'in the food chain?'

779
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:42,631
Stay in the club?

780
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:45,231
Yes, I did.

781
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:46,764
'I'm sorry, Maggie.'

782
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:47,897
You're sorry, my ass.

783
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,297
PCA Machine
isn't working

784
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,797
then they hooked
it up wrong.

785
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,231
No, it's hooked up right.

786
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:56,597
She just, she doesn't know
whether to give him

787
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:57,764
a booster shot or not.

788
00:38:57,797 --> 00:38:58,797
If she thinks
Ricky needs it..

789
00:38:58,831 --> 00:38:59,931
But she can't tell.

790
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:01,264
Well, if she is in doubt

791
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,897
she should just go ahead
and give it to him.

792
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:04,797
I mean, I'm afraid it's not
gonna matter that much.

793
00:39:04,831 --> 00:39:06,764
I don't think he's gonna make
it through the night.

794
00:39:11,297 --> 00:39:14,931
I told her we'd
go over there.

795
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,264
Like, why? I..

796
00:39:16,297 --> 00:39:17,731
She knows how
to work the machine.

797
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:19,631
What‐what are we
gonna do?

798
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:20,664
She's all alone, Doug.

799
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:22,597
She's really scared.

800
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:24,064
I understand, it's just,
I don't know what good

801
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:27,931
it'll do for us to be there
watching her son die.

802
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:30,197
I know.
I mean, I‐I don't know.

803
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:32,297
Probably won't do
any good. I just..

804
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:33,597
I really wanna be there.

805
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,097
Okay.

806
00:39:42,231 --> 00:39:44,931
I'll probably be
home pretty late.

807
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,997
Mobalage, they told me
you were here.

808
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,764
I didn't know
what was wrong.

809
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,297
Kubby, this is Dr. Greene.

810
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,731
Dr. Greene,
this is my wife, Kubby.

811
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:06,097
‐ Nice to meet you.
‐ How do you do?

812
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,231
I strained my back
and, uh, Dr. Greene

813
00:40:08,264 --> 00:40:10,097
was kind enough
to take a look at it

814
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,697
and, uh give me some
pain medication.

815
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:16,664
Yeah, it's gonna
probably be better

816
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:18,197
in a couple of days.

817
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:19,764
Thank you.

818
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:22,164
Sometimes he tries to do
too much at his job.

819
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:23,931
He works too hard.

820
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,331
Yes, I know.

821
00:40:25,364 --> 00:40:26,764
I'll be fine.

822
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:30,331
Thank you again, Dr. Greene.

823
00:40:30,364 --> 00:40:31,931
You're welcome.

824
00:40:42,964 --> 00:40:44,931
Uh, you're the only man
sitting alone

825
00:40:44,964 --> 00:40:46,931
so I'm hoping you're
Sam Broder, right?

826
00:40:46,964 --> 00:40:48,997
Dr. Weaver,
nice to meet you.

827
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,264
Call me Kerry.

828
00:40:51,997 --> 00:40:53,264
My office tells me
that you've made

829
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:54,764
three or four
appointments before

830
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:57,697
and always canceled them
at the last minute.

831
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:59,197
You'd think
I was the dentist.

832
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,297
Yeah, I'm sorry.

833
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,164
It's alright,
it's pretty common.

834
00:41:02,197 --> 00:41:04,297
Making the decision to track
down your birth parents

835
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,097
is not something
you should do lightly.

836
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:08,264
I've done that whole
internet thing.

837
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:09,864
Yeah, most people
start there

838
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:11,264
but I do this
for a living.

839
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:12,797
My company handled
several hundred

840
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:15,597
adoption cases last year.

841
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:17,064
Sounds like a good living.

842
00:41:18,731 --> 00:41:20,031
'I'm gonna need
your full name'

843
00:41:20,064 --> 00:41:21,697
'date of birth,
place of birth'

844
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,731
'and the names of your
adoptive parents.'

845
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:29,831
I'm glad you
could step in

846
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,264
on such short
notice, Robert.

847
00:41:31,297 --> 00:41:33,231
I'm always happy to get
a 16‐year‐old up and running.

848
00:41:33,264 --> 00:41:35,697
Get him back out there, kissing
the girls making 'em cry.

849
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:40,131
So, uh, how's this interim
chief thing working out?

850
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,864
‐ Oh, miserably.
‐ Hmm.

851
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:43,297
Between my surgical duties

852
00:41:43,331 --> 00:41:45,564
and all the administrative
crap down there..

853
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:46,931
Yeah, it's a shame
Kerry Weaver

854
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:48,297
wasn't able to continue.

855
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,197
And on top of surgery,
you're chief of staff..

856
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:52,797
Oh, I tackle that part
of my job around midnight.

857
00:41:52,831 --> 00:41:54,831
Alright, hey, didn't it
work out fairly well

858
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:57,331
when David Morgenstern
was handling surgery and ER?

859
00:41:57,364 --> 00:41:58,931
Yeah, he did seem
to have it down.

860
00:41:58,964 --> 00:42:00,764
Well, then, Donald,
I feel I'd be remiss

861
00:42:00,797 --> 00:42:02,797
if I didn't offer
up my services.

862
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,664
To be interim chief
of the ER?

863
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:06,031
No, I think "acting chief"
has a bit more

864
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:07,797
je ne sais quoi, don't you?

865
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,897
I don't care if you call
yourself almighty God

866
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:11,297
if you're willing
to take that on.

867
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,031
Although, we'd still be
conducting a search.

868
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,931
Yeah, well, hey,
long as you need me.

869
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,264
Huh, I needed you today.

870
00:42:16,297 --> 00:42:17,831
Uh, how's tomorrow sound?

871
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:19,597
Like a stroke of luck.

872
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:27,264
Sorry, it's only instant.

873
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,597
There was a day
I used to grind the beans.

874
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,064
Don't worry about it.
Anything is fine.

875
00:42:33,797 --> 00:42:35,064
Stay here. I'll get it.

876
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:57,297
Hi.

877
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:00,764
Hi.
