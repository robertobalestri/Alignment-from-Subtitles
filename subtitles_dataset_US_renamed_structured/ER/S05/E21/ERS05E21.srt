1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,466
Previously on "ER".

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,233
I guess a candlelit dinner
would not be an enticing offer.

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:12,200
You're offering me
a cardiothoracic spot?

4
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:15,033
Not officially until May,
but between you and me..

5
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:16,700
Hold on, hold on.
I'm covering the ER. Alright?

6
00:00:16,733 --> 00:00:18,600
Fine. I'm finished here.

7
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:20,666
Peter's applied
for the Trauma Fellowship?

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,200
Yeah.
Hadn't you heard?

9
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:24,400
What do you think he'll do?

10
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:25,700
He'll be on the first plane.

11
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,033
Oh! Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry.

12
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,766
Ah, that's alright.
It's part of the game.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Being swatted by a ball?

14
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:42,200
No, it's called a hindrance.
It's a do‐over.

15
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,566
So I don't get penalized
or anything like that?

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
‐ No, I got in the way.
‐ Okay.

17
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,666
‐ So when do you go in?
‐ Noon. You?

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Depends.
I may have a meeting.

19
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,333
About the Trauma Fellowship?

20
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,600
‐ Maybe.
‐ That's not very nice.

21
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,300
I mean,
I don't know when, actually.

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,266
Romano,
he keeps stalling.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,466
Don't worry.
You're more than qualified.

24
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,433
'Oh!
Oh, I'm so sorry.'

25
00:01:09,466 --> 00:01:11,233
Why do you have to stand there?

26
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,700
I've got to stand somewhere.

27
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,700
I didn't mean
to hit you, honestly.

28
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,266
Here, I have an idea.
Why don't you serve?

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,366
Okay.

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,233
You can't be enjoying this
very much.

31
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:22,233
Remember, the ball
has to bounce first.

32
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,400
Right.

33
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:27,700
Bollocks.

34
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,333
Blood pressure's fine.

35
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,500
‐ How are you feeling?
‐ A lot better.

36
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:35,366
Yeah, that happens once
you reach your second trimester.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,266
I didn't gain any weight
in the first trimester.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,166
Now, all of a sudden I've put on
two pounds in one week?

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,633
Get used to it.

40
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,033
I'll have Alice schedule
your midterm ultrasound.

41
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,066
Do you want to know
your baby's sex?

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,400
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

43
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,400
Well, just tell me
before we start

44
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,100
and we'll get
an alpha fetoprotein.

45
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,733
It's an indicator
of spina bifida.

46
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,566
‐ And Down's syndrome.
‐ Right.

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,266
‐ You think I'm at risk?
‐ No. AFP standard.

48
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,633
We typically only do amnio
when you're over 35

49
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,666
unless you have genetic
disorders in your family.

50
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,133
No.

51
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,400
‐ Cystic fibrosis? Tay‐Sachs?
‐ No.

52
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,600
‐ What about father's side?
‐ I don't think so.

53
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:12,033
Well, you should
check on that

54
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,433
but everything looks fine.
Very healthy pregnancy.

55
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,733
'Dr. Ross. Leave a message.'

56
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,633
Hey, Doug. It's me.

57
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,566
Uh, I‐I know we said
we shouldn't call for a while

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,300
um, but I needed
to tell you something.

59
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,100
I faxed it..

60
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:36,566
...and, uh..

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,166
...um, I really want you
to read it

62
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,500
and...sit with it
for a while.

63
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,100
Um..

64
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,100
...and then,
then we'll talk about it.

65
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:50,700
Okay.

66
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,533
I, um..
Okay.

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,133
Bye.

68
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,500
♪ Semper fi do or die ♪

69
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,066
♪ Die for my brother ♪

70
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,033
I said die for my brother.

71
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:11,123
2 mgs of Ativan for the duke
here and hang a banana bag.

72
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,723
Kerry, I hear you have
a rule‐out AAA?

73
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:14,056
Yeah, Exam Four.

74
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,690
Oh, listen. Sorry, I had
to cancel the meeting‐‐

75
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,690
Hey, doc.
I'm one of a few good men.

76
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,590
That's good. Get a job.

77
00:04:19,623 --> 00:04:20,890
Sorry I had to cancel
the meeting.

78
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,656
I had a perfed appy
that wouldn't wait

79
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,723
but I'll have
my office reschedule.

80
00:04:23,756 --> 00:04:24,693
I spoke to Anspaugh.

81
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,926
He's gonna come back for it
after his seminar at 10:00.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,393
Uh, it's a little past
my bedtime.

83
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:29,993
‐ Can I tell you something?
‐ I figured that.

84
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,060
He said you could present
your top three candidates

85
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,093
and I'll pass them along.

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,526
I bet you would.

87
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,460
I'm just trying to prevent
any further delay.

88
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,226
Very conscientious of you,
Kerry.

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,560
‐ Thank you.
‐ I'll be there.

90
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:43,126
‐ I appreciate that.
‐ Kerry, um..

91
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,393
‐ You mind if I call you Kerry?
‐ Oh, certainly, Robert.

92
00:04:45,426 --> 00:04:47,993
‐ Here. Here, thank you.
‐ Hey, doc..

93
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,493
I know how much this
little project means to you.

94
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:52,226
Well, actually,
I guess I don't

95
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,593
but you would be smart
not to raid my surgical staff.

96
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,193
If you're referring
to Peter Benton

97
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:59,260
and Elizabeth Corday,
they both came to me.

98
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,426
Well, you can
send them right back.

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,193
I didn't realize that
you owned them.

100
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:04,093
Well, now you do.

101
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,626
Hire some hump
from the outside.

102
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,626
Make life
a lot easier.

103
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,060
Don't tell me you want
to see a picture.

104
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,293
No need to
see a picture.

105
00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:11,560
Good, 'cause that
would turn her off.

106
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:13,093
Chuny, I don't need
to be fixed up.

107
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,993
‐ I'm not that pathetic.
‐ Who's pathetic?

108
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,126
Carter won't
meet my friend.

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,126
You met her.
The Urology nurse, Gina.

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,060
‐ Oh, yeah. She's nice.
‐ What's the matter, Carter?

111
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:22,493
Are you afraid she's touched
too many...you know.

112
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:24,393
Facial and abdominal trauma
coming in.

113
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:26,326
Little league umpire
got beat up.

114
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,060
One too many bad calls,
I guess.

115
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,360
I guess.

116
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:31,326
What is this country coming to?
Little league?

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
You should see what happened
to the scoutmaster I treated.

118
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:35,226
Come on, Carter.
Just meet her.

119
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,226
‐ I don't date nurses.
‐ Just med students, huh?

120
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,593
No. I keep my love life
out of the workplace.

121
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,526
‐ Thank you very much.
‐ Since when?

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,393
I got a woman freaking out in
two. Something alive in her ear.

123
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,626
Carter. Jerry, page surgery.
I'll go meet the umpire outside.

124
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,060
Okay.

125
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:49,326
Hey, look what
the cat dragged in.

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,160
‐ What?
‐ You don't look so good, honey.

127
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,426
No, I'm just tired. I've been
working the night shifts.

128
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,893
Slept during the day,
didn't you?

129
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:56,560
Yeah, a little,
but I'm fine.

130
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,260
What the hell is that?

131
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,026
It's cool, huh?
Sound activated.

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,226
I picked it up
at Grossman's flea market.

133
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,993
Wasn't the "Macarena" in,
like, two years ago?

134
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,426
Three. I did it
at my college graduation.

135
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,426
Really?
Why don't you show us?

136
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,993
In your dreams.

137
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:12,526
My friend knows
how to do the "Macarena".

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh, yeah.

139
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,126
♪ ..Macarena.. ♪

140
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,993
‐ Did you bruise?
‐ No, I don't think so.

141
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:20,326
‐ I'm afraid to check.
‐ I'm sure you'll live.

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,226
I didn't realize
that racquetball

143
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,926
was a full‐contact sport.

144
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,626
I guess it's not my thing.

145
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,326
Well, looked like you were
having fun there for a while.

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
Yeah, I was.

147
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,626
It was a bit too bizarre
bumping into Peter like that.

148
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,493
‐ How so?
‐ You weren't uncomfortable?

149
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,026
No. Should I have been?

150
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,626
I don't think
this is our umpire.

151
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,060
‐ You a doctor?
‐ Yeah.

152
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:40,926
Lance Carmichael, FBI.

153
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,093
We've got a woman
that's been shot.

154
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,326
Uh‐huh. What happened?

155
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,993
Gunshot wound
to the upper torso.

156
00:06:45,026 --> 00:06:46,093
She's conscious,
but having trouble breathing.

157
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,926
Why didn't you call
an ambulance?

158
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,426
‐ Can't tell you that.
‐ Excuse me?

159
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,626
Active operation.

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,326
We had to abort
our medical protocol.

161
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
‐ What?
‐ Officially, we're not here.

162
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,493
Resps are labored,
pulse 130.

163
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:02,260
‐ I'll get a gurney.
‐ Ma'am?

164
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,926
‐ Can you tell me your name?
‐ Sorry.

165
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,460
That's
confidential information.

166
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,560
I'm trying to assess
her level of consciousness.

167
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,193
‐ Amber.
‐ Okay, Amber.

168
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,426
Why don't you tell me
how it happened?

169
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,593
That's also confidential.

170
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,026
Look, you want me
to help her?

171
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,526
Strictly need‐to‐know
information.

172
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,126
Okay.

173
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,626
Amber, can you tell me
where you got hit?

174
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,093
It felt like my chest,
but it hurts on the side.

175
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:25,626
‐ Uh‐huh. How long ago?
‐ Eighteen and a half minutes.

176
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,660
‐ What's your name?
‐ Dr. Greene.

177
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:30,160
‐ Social security number?
‐ What?

178
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,960
Got to run a check.

179
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,260
Get it out.
Just get it out!

180
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:37,560
Ma'am? You're gonna
have to hold still.

181
00:07:37,593 --> 00:07:41,093
What is it?
What is it?

182
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,526
I can still feel it
moving around.

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,526
I irrigated with Lidocaine.
It should be dead by now.

184
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,993
What? What should be dead?

185
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,460
Well..

186
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:53,960
...it looks
like a cockroach.

187
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:57,126
Ma'am, I can get it out.

188
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,926
‐ I can get it out.
‐ Oh.

189
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,126
I can get it out.
If you'll just hold still.

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,593
I don't want to puncture
your eardrum.

191
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm suing the bastard.

192
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:08,626
‐ Who is that, ma'am?
‐ My landlord.

193
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,326
I complained three times.

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,060
I take a nap and wake up
with one in my ear.

195
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,926
I'm going to take him
for everything he has.

196
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Well, until then..

197
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,926
...I'd sleep with earplugs.

198
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:23,193
I got it.

199
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:35,226
Alright.
We'll get that cleaned up.

200
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,360
You just...sit still
and I'll be right back.

Lydia, can I get
a 19‐gauge angiocath?

203
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,093
‐ Sure.
‐ And some Valium.

204
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,093
‐ What you got, headache?
‐ I'm fine.

205
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:53,293
We need a secured area,
but more than one exit.

206
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:55,193
‐ Carter, is trauma one open?
‐ Yeah, what have you got?

207
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,526
We got a gunshot wound to the
chest, possible pneumothorax.

208
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,260
The metal may have slowed
the bullet down.

209
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,060
‐ Talk about a Wonder bra, huh?
‐ Bra saved her life?

210
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,026
‐ Do you need these people?
‐ They can help.

211
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,226
Essential personnel only.

212
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,660
‐ This is?
‐ FBI.

213
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:07,326
It's all very cloak‐and‐dagger.

I'm looking for
a few good men here!

You're going to have to stay
away from this patient.

I am. Mark?

217
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,093
Elizabeth and I can
take it from here.

218
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,060
We're gonna
need some nurses.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Relax, okay?

220
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,593
This happens all the time.
Just relax.

221
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,126

222
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,593

‐ Bowel obstruction.

Tedious, huh?
Well, don't worry.

226
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,226

227

00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,993
Excuse me?

the cardiothoracic fellowship,

and fight for you

00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:47,626

making your decision

Besides, I don't want
my guy going off to..

239
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,226
...waste his talents
as some glorified ER doc.

240
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,060
Well, uh, I wouldn't exactly
consider it a waste.

241
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:05,326
Peter, look, I know you're
confused with your son and all

242
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,593
and we can be flexible
about that

243
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,526
but you know,
let's get real.

244
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,126
You've worked too long
and too hard to settle

245
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,426
for patching up gang bangers
and drunk drivers

246
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,960
for the rest of your career.

247
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,926
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

248
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,093
Good. So I need to know.

249
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:22,960
You're my guy?

250
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,493
Look, if you're asking me
if I'm interested

251
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:26,026

I'm going to make
a small incision.

255
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,526
Will there be a scar?

256
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,660
We'll hide this one
under your arm.

257
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:42,560
There's oozing
at the point of entry.

258
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,293
Let's apply
another pressure dressing.

259

‐ Easy on the painkillers.
‐ She's been shot.

261
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,026
She needs to stay
clearheaded.

262
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,593
I promise I won't listen to
anything her lips might utter.

263
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:55,593
‐ I got some fluid here.
‐ Blood?

264
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,226
‐ Nothing in the chest cavity.
‐ I don't know what it is.

265
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,093
It looks like saline.

266
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:00,626
Amber, do you have
breast implants?

267
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,426
You popped my boob?

268
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,393
Uh, the bullet did, but
the implant might have helped..

269
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,893
Sorry, this area
is off limits.

270
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:07,960
We need Merocel sponges.
We're out.

271
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:09,226
Get them someplace else.

272
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,093
Mark, I gotta stop
this guy's nosebleed.

273
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,493
That doesn't
sound serious.

274
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,993
‐ Are you a doctor?
‐ No.

275
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:15,626

278
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
And relax.

279
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:22,460
Did you just shoot that?

280
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,493
What?

281
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:25,493
Did you just shoot that X‐ray?

282
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,626
‐ Yeah.
‐ I was in the room.

283
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,993
‐ I said shooting.
‐ What's wrong with you?

284
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:31,393
'Wait, what's happening?'

285
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,193
He just took an X‐ray
while I was in the room.

286
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,926
‐ What's wrong with you?
‐ Hey, Carol, it's okay.

287
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,460
We've all been exposed
at one time or another.

288
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,593
I can't! You have
to be more careful.

289
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,526
She's very lucky.
No vital organ damage.

290
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,193
‐ When can we move her?
‐ We'll get her a bed upstairs.

291
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,493
No, we need to move her
to another facility.

292
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,060
One we can control.

293
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,060
Well, I need to monitor her
for a few more hours

294
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,993
before you can transport her.

295
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:03,126
Are you done with that?

296
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,560
‐ For now.
‐ I'll take it.

297
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:08,360
And we'll need all original
documentation of any kind.

298
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:11,560
Okay. The hospital keeps charts,
even on Jane Does.

299
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:13,360
We can't allow that.

300
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,493
Let me guess.

301
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,493
This conversation
never happened?

302
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,293
Crit's 44. Looks good.

303
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,593
I'll take that.

304
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,060
'Okay, how're we gonna
bill this?'

305
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,460
The bureau will be in touch.

306
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:30,193
I'm gonna have to call
my Chief of Staff.

307
00:12:30,226 --> 00:12:32,660
Mark, we need the room.
Multiple MVAs coming in.

308
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:34,260
Alright, let's go.

309
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:35,960
Wait. What are you doing?

310
00:12:35,993 --> 00:12:37,293
We got a traffic accident
coming in.

311
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:38,993
We're moving her
to an observation room.

312
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,193
Put them someplace else.

313
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,526
This room is set up
for trauma.

314
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
This is a national security
matter.

315
00:12:43,593 --> 00:12:45,526
I don't have time
to argue with you guys.

316
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,326
‐ So who is she?
‐ I don't know.

317
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,393
‐ What she look like?
‐ A stripper.

318
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,260
I'm guessing
witness protection program.

319
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:54,526
Yeah, Jerry, a stripper.

320
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,126
That's a way
to keep a low profile.

321
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,993
Could be an undercover agent,
I suppose.

322
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,460
She don't look like
the undercover type to me.

323
00:12:59,493 --> 00:13:00,560
Isn't that the point?

324
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:02,493
I'm guessing
mobster's girlfriend.

325
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:04,360
‐ Or a politician's.
‐ Maybe both.

326
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,426
Got a medevac coming in.
Boating accident in Berwyn.

327
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,026
‐ ETA?
‐ Five minutes.

328
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,926
Ah, it's gonna be
a long night.

329
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,060
Mark, can you take these?
I got a medevac coming in.

330
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,626
‐ Yeah, let's go.
‐ What do we got?

331
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,626

you're feeling better.

333
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:22,026

Is her airway clear?

338
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,026
Yeah.
BP is 130/85, pulse 90.

339
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,193
My name's Elizabeth.
What's yours?

340
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,360
Shannon.

341
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:36,293
Shannon, I want you
to press your foot

342
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:38,926
against my hand just like
you're stepping on the gas.

343
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,326
I can't!

344
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,126
Possible spinal cord injury.
Let's be careful and go.

345
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,326
'They were on their way
to the prom.'

346
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
Hit a telephone pole
and rolled it.

347
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,926
Restrained driver,
second and third‐degree burns

348
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,293
to the bilateral hands
and forearms.

349
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,593
Pulled his friend out
after the gas tank exploded.

350
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:52,926
'Complains of chest pains.'

351
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,393
Where's Travis?
Did he make it?

352
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,626
We got partial thickness here.

353
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,293
Ten milligrams of Morphine
IV push.

354
00:13:57,326 --> 00:13:59,393
‐ How's his buddy doing?
‐ Carter? Carter.

355
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,160
Oh, God.

356
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:05,260
Travis Mitchell,
18‐year‐old rear seat passenger.

357
00:14:05,293 --> 00:14:06,593
'Head injury left him
unconscious in the burning car'

358
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,226
'and his friend
pulled him out.'

359
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Seventy five percent
body surface area burned.

360
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,360
Mainly full thickness. Gave him
a liter of saline en route.

361
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,593
‐ What's his pressure?
‐ '94/68, pulse 130.'

362
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:16,126
‐ Did you find Melissa?
‐ He's waking up.

363
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,460
But he's asking all these
repetitive questions.

364
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,960
Travis. Travis,
my name is Dr. Carter.

365
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,126
Are you having
any trouble breathing?

366
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,360
Are you short of
breath at all?

367
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,660
‐ Where's Melissa?
‐ Who's Melissa?

368
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:25,260
She's my girlfriend.
She was in the backseat.

369
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:26,626
‐ Did she make it out?
‐ I don't know, doc.

370
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,193
There were three victims
and they hadn't cleared

371
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,426
the car yet when we left.

372
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:36,326
‐ 'I'll take the airway.
‐ What do we got?

373
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,093
Andrea Brodoff,
34‐year‐old female.

374
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,893
Rammed the boat into dock
with an attack of bad nausea.

375
00:14:41,926 --> 00:14:44,126
Be careful. I have AIDS.

376
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,593
'Penetrating abdominal injury.'

377
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,193
What's her pressure?

378
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:50,260
95/60 after 800 CCs saline.

379
00:14:50,293 --> 00:14:51,560
‐ What's this?
‐ 'Fishing pole.'

380
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:53,460
We had to cut it off
to transport.

381
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,660
Ma'am, does it hurt
on this side?

382
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,926
Yes!

383
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,493
‐ Who's this?
‐ This is Bruce.

384
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:58,660
He's fine.
He was wearing his seatbelt.

385
00:14:58,693 --> 00:14:59,893
Mom wouldn't take off
without him.

386
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:01,326
Alright, let's go!

387
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
‐ Taking Bruce?
‐ 'I'll take him.'

388
00:15:02,593 --> 00:15:04,560
Come on, Bruce.
Come on, sweetie.

389
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,526
‐ 'Solu‐Medrol's on board.'
‐ 'Can you lift your leg?'

390
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,493
‐ No.
‐ How about your knee?

391
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,460
Oh, my God!
What's happening?!

392
00:15:16,226 --> 00:15:17,593
Babinski is positive.

393
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,260
‐ Is that bad?
‐ 'Okay.'

394
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,626
I want you to try and push
against my hand

395
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,593
with your big toe.

396
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:25,926
Alright, very good.

397
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,226
‐ Where's X‐ray?
‐ Coming.

398
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,493
Shannon, I'm gonna test the area
around your rectum.

399
00:15:30,526 --> 00:15:32,260
It might be
a little uncomfortable.

400
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:35,160
‐ I won't be paralyzed, will I?
‐ Let's not worry about that.

401
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:37,193
I just need you to focus
right now, okay?

402
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,426
‐ Dr. Greene? Carter needs you.
‐ What is it?

403
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,626
Burn victim.

404
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,226
‐ Is that my brother?
‐ Who?

405
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,593
The burn victim.
Is that Travis?

406
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,426
Just relax, Shannon.
We're doing everything we can.

407
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,393
I'll be right back.

408
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,626
Four units, ABG
and carboxyhemoglobin.

409
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,393
What do you got, Carter?

410
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:58,293
I got full‐thickness burns,
maybe 80%.

411
00:15:58,326 --> 00:16:00,893
At a 190 pounds,
I'm, uh, calculating

412
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,993
1700 CCs of Lactated Ringers
per hour.

413
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,393
‐ Sounds right.
‐ Yeah?

414
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:05,960
Alright, Lydia,
let's go ahead and do that.

415
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,560
How about vascular exam?

416
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,926
Good peripheral pulses so far.

417
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,093
Lucy, what do we do
during fluid resuscitation

418
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,060
'to prevent
constricting edema?'

419
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,626
Um, elevate the limbs

420
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,160
and, uh, do range of motion
exercises.

421
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:21,060
'That's right. Why don't you
start on the left leg?'

422
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,426
Is that my sister
over there?

423
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,593
‐ Yeah.
‐ What's wrong with her?

424
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:26,593
We don't know yet.
She was thrown from the car.

425
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,993
Is she gonna be alright?

426
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:30,026
She asked the same thing
about you.

427
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,960
Now really move it, Lucy.
He can't feel it.

428
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,293
'How's the debridement coming?'

429
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,593
'It's gonna take a while.'

430
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:39,026
'BP's 95/65.'

431
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,626
Alright, good bowel sounds.
Give me an ultrasound.

432
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,293
I'll be right back. Lucy,
why don't you come with me?

433
00:16:45,326 --> 00:16:47,260
Go. I got this.

434
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,660
Find the kid's parents
and get them over here.

435
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,493
What should I tell them?

436
00:16:54,526 --> 00:16:56,493
Tell them that their children
were in a serious accident.

437
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:58,560
‐ Don't get into specifics.
‐ Okay.

438
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:01,326
Lucy, burns like that
can be pretty brutal.

439
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
It's okay to bow out
your first time.

440
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:05,626
‐ Do you think he has a chance?
‐ There's always a chance.

441
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,593
Have you ever seen one
this bad survive?

442
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,193
‐ No.
‐ Doc.

443
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:10,926
We can't control
this environment.

444
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,126
Transport's en route.
I need you to clear her.

445
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,260
She has a chest tube.
She needs to be observed.

446
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:17,393
You provided
a valuable service.

447
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:19,060
We appreciate it.

448
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:20,893
We've arranged
for ongoing care.

449
00:17:20,926 --> 00:17:23,093
I don't know what to tell you,
okay? She may need surgery.

450
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,993
I'm not going to release her
until I know that she's stable.

451
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:27,926
That's our problem.

452
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,060
Dr. Greene,
you got a sec?

453
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:32,226
Hold on, okay?
I'll check her in a minute.

454
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,060
I'm gonna need a blood alcohol
level on all these kids.

455
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,593
Especially this one.
He was driving.

456
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,126
He pulled his friend
out of the fire.

457
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,293
Yeah. He also ran the car
into a telephone pole.

458
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,626
It's early.
They're already drunk?

459
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,426
They were heading
from a pre‐party to the prom.

460
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,926
He said some parents
were serving beer.

461
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,560
Oh, geez. Alright.

462
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:47,093
Uh, how's the fourth one?

463
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:49,060
‐ Haven't found her yet.
‐ Mm.

‐ I got really sick.

470
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,226
I hit the throttle
too hard.

471
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,393

472

‐ He's in the lounge.

475

We're keeping a good eye on him.

476
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,326
It looks like blood
in Morison's pouch.

477
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,626
She might have
nicked her liver.

478
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,593

00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,193
I can't keep anything down.
And then..

482
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,960
...the CMV just makes it worse.

483
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:26,560

‐ Yeah.

How are we doing?

496
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,060
She has some sensation
on the perianal area

497
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,626
and reflex contraction
of the sphincter.

498
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,293
Incomplete cord lesion
with a compression fracture

499

of the first lumbar vertebrae.

500
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,326
There's a small, bony fragment
impinging on her spinal cord.

501
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,560
Did you pump her
full of steroids?

1800 milligrams
bolus IV Solu‐Medrol.

503

You'll take her
to surgery?

504
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:05,293
If we can decompress it

505
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:06,626
she has a chance

She's not here,
but I'll sign the order.

508
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:11,360
Okay, let's go.

509
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:12,660
If this girl doesn't feel
anything in 24 hours

510
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,160
she ain't gonna.

511
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,160

I've got this sorted out.

00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:18,560
The driver's date is the girl
with the spinal cord injury.

513
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:20,593
And her brother is
the burn victim and apparently

514
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,293
there's a fourth victim,
Melissa, no one can find.

515
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,226
And the parents of the driver
are on their way

516
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,893
and I spoke to some neighbors
who are staying

517
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,493
at the brother and sister's
house and apparently

518
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,293
their parents are staying
overnight in Milwaukee

519
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,626
but I have a call
into their hotel.

520
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,293
Okay, good.

521
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:35,360
Carter, how are we doing?

522
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:36,993
Compromised circulation.

523
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:39,326
His legs are cyanotic,
and I'm losing his pulse.

524
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
We've prepped
for an escharotomy.

525
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:41,460
Okay, go ahead.

526
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,193
Ten blade.

527
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:44,960
What's happening?

528
00:19:44,993 --> 00:19:48,893
The swelling is constricting
your blood supply, okay?

529
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,660
So we need to make an incision
in the skin to release it.

530
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:53,393
You're slicing
my skin open?

531
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,493
Don't worry. You're not gonna
feel a thing, okay?

532
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:59,126
Lucy, why don't you go,
uh, talk him through it?

533
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,593
All the way down
to the subcu fat.

534
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:22,193
Did he start?

535
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,260
See? It doesn't hurt.

536
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:25,393
Will they be able to..

537
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:27,326
Will they be able to sew
this back?

538
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,026
We would do a skin graft.

539
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,460
Wait. You would or you will?

540
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,960
We will.

541
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,026
I got the medial aspect.

542
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,393
Okay, one centimeter
proximal and distal

543
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:41,360
to the circumferential burn.

544
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,993
Did you...did you find
M‐Melissa?

545
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,293
Not yet.

546
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:51,060
We're supposed..

547
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:53,026
We're supposed to be
at the prom right now..

548
00:20:53,993 --> 00:20:56,260
...d...dancing.

549
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:59,626
Was there a theme at your prom?

550
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,993
Yeah. The '40s.

551
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,493
I was, uh..

552
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:05,126
I was gonna wear a zoot suit,
but Melissa..

553
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,093
...she wanted a tux.

554
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,493
Okay, that's one.

555
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:13,993
Halfway there.

556
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,593
Dr. Greene.

557
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,193
Uh, the FBI's
looking for you.

558
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:24,260
‐ Alright, they'll have to wait.
‐ Dr. Greene?

559
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,993
‐ Yeah.
‐ Todd Hoffman, FBI.

560
00:21:26,026 --> 00:21:27,893
Did you treat a gunshot wound
to the chest

561
00:21:27,926 --> 00:21:29,393
in the last six hours?

562
00:21:29,426 --> 00:21:32,093
I told your other guys that
she's not ready to transport.

563
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,460
‐ What other guys?
‐ Right in here.

564
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:40,293
They were anxious
to get her out of here.

565
00:21:40,326 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll bet they were.

566
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,193
And you believed them?

567
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,493
They flashed a badge at me
just like you did.

568
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:53,393
Why didn't you
put out an APB?

569
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,026
I need all the medical reports.

570
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,293
Well, they took everything,
I think.

571
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,460
‐ Everything?
‐ Who are these guys?

572
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:00,360
That's a need‐to‐know.

573
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:02,326
Do you have any idea
where they might be heading?

574
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,426
Uh, no.
They were acting like G‐Men.

575
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,960
How's that?

576
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,393
Well, they were asking
a lot of questions

577
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,626
and not giving out
much information.

578
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:11,660
‐ Jerry.
‐ Sorry. Sorry.

579
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,193
We're gonna have
to confiscate the tapes

580
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:14,460
from your surveillance cameras.

581
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,993
Yeah? Well, talk to security.

582
00:22:16,026 --> 00:22:17,426
Jerry, put that thing away.

583
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,160
I don't want to see it
out here again.

584
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:21,060
Hey, Carol.
Carol!

585
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:23,293
Excuse me.
We're looking for my daughter.

586
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:25,226
She‐she was in the car accident.

587
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,593
Shannon Mitchell?

588
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:30,426
No, b‐but she was
in the same car. Melissa Harold.

589
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,160
I'm sorry, your daughter
hasn't been brought in yet.

590
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:36,226
A‐another parent told us
everyone was brought here.

591
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,993
The police and the paramedics
are still looking for Melissa.

592
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:40,493
‐ Where is she?
‐ They're st..

593
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,426
‐ They're still looking for her.
‐ Where?

594
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,193
I think that you should speak
with a police officer.

595
00:22:45,226 --> 00:22:48,460
Reggie.
Come over here.

596
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,393
These are
Melissa Harold's parents

597
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:52,193
and they need information.

598
00:22:52,226 --> 00:22:55,060
‐ Our daughter's missing?
‐ I'm afraid so.

599
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:56,893
But she doesn't appear to have
been trapped in the vehicle.

600
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,393
Doesn't appear?

601
00:22:58,426 --> 00:23:00,360
The car caught fire, ma'am.

602
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:04,160
Hey. Are you alright?

603
00:23:04,193 --> 00:23:06,493
I'm fine.
I'm sorry about before.

604
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:09,093
I'm just,
I'm having a bad day today.

605
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,960
Yeah. I'd say it was
a little more than that.

606
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:14,526
I'm really not
in the mood right now, Kerry.

607
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,293
Are you pregnant?

608
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:20,926
Who told you?

609
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,326
Nobody had to tell me.
You were upset about the X‐ray.

610
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,326
You didn't want to expose
the fetus to CMV.

611
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:29,293
It was instinct,
you know.

612
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,893
I mean, I don't mind
taking on the risks

613
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,093
of working
in a hospital myself, but..

614
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,126
It's perfectly
understandable.

615
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,660
How far along
are you?

616
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,626
Almost 15 weeks.

617
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,360
Good. You didn't
expose yourself

618
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,360
during the first trimester.

619
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:47,426
Feel free to opt out of treating
infectious patients

620
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,393
or doing anything that doesn't
make you feel comfortable

621
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:54,126
and we'll just deal with
the rest as we go along, okay?

622
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,293
Okay.

623
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:58,526
‐ Thanks, Kerry.
‐ Sure.

624
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:03,193
'Expose the spinous process
and lamina.'

625
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:04,526
There. There it is.

626
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,960
I can see the
bony spicule

627
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,293
impinging
on the spinal cord.

628
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,193
No wonder this kid
couldn't move her legs.

629
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:12,426
Let's rongeur
that little troublemaker.

630
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,626
So...have you thought
about what I said?

631
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,393
What was that?

632
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:18,993
About not wasting your life
on this Trauma Fellowship.

633
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,460
What? And miss out
on cases like this?

634
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,893
You're avoiding
the question.

635
00:24:23,926 --> 00:24:25,193
Frankly, I don't think
I've a lot of options

636
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,626
at the moment, have I?

637
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,660
I'd consider you
for cardiothoracic.

638
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,593
I could sneak in
a late application.

639
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:33,293
I thought that
belonged to Peter.

640
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:35,393
Well, he didn't hesitate
to throw his hat

641
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:37,360
into your rice bowl, did he?

642
00:24:38,993 --> 00:24:40,326
This fragment's
really embedded.

643
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,593
Careful.

644
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,160
Not a large margin
of error here.

645
00:24:47,093 --> 00:24:49,060
You shouldn't be
out of bed.

646
00:24:49,093 --> 00:24:50,593
He's gonna die,
isn't he?

647
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:51,893
It's too early to tell.

648
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:54,326
I need you to sit down here

649
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,593
and I need to take a look
at those dressings.

650
00:24:59,693 --> 00:25:02,526
So...your X‐ray

651
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
shows that you have
a fractured rib.

652
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:05,926
Okay.

653
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,060
It's gonna hurt
for a few weeks

654
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,026
but it'll heal
on its own.

655
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,193
It's a brave thing you did

656
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:17,126
going back in there
for your friend.

657
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,260
It won't matter, will it?

658
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:22,260
We're doing everything we can.

659
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:24,626
They took my blood.

660
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,993
They think it's 'cause
I was drunk, don't they?

661
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,893
Your blood alcohol
level was .09.

662
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,860
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

663
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,060
Let me know
if you're in too much pain.

664
00:25:37,093 --> 00:25:38,593
Oh, my God.

665
00:25:38,626 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh, my God! Justin!

666
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:43,360
You alright?
Is he going to be alright?

667
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:44,893
It's okay, mom.
I'm okay.

668
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,360
What happened?

669
00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:49,026
It was the CD player.

670
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,160
I went to change the CD.

671
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:52,993
I totaled the car.

672
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:57,960
Pulse ox is dropping.
It's 93 on 15 liters of oxygen.

673
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,360
Any burns to the airway?

674
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,660
Yeah. He had some
singed nasal hair.

675
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,560
Good chance
of laryngeal edema.

676
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,093
What's the word
on the Burn Unit?

677
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:05,360
They had to call in
a registry nurse.

678
00:26:05,393 --> 00:26:06,993
She should be here
in about an hour.

679
00:26:07,026 --> 00:26:09,060
Okay. You should tube
while he's still got an airway.

680
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:10,960
Yeah, I was just waiting
for the parents to get here.

681
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:12,926
They're on the road.
They left half an hour ago.

682
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,526
‐ How about the sister?
‐ She's still in surgery.

683
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,260
You know, maybe you could
call the neighbors

684
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,926
to see if the parents
have a car phone.

685
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,293
It's up to you, Carter,
but I don't want to hear

686
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:20,560
you had to cric him.

687
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:22,093
Understood.

688
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,993
So what happens
if we don't reach them?

689
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,226
I tube him, and he dies
in the Burn Unit

690
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,926
within the next week.

691
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,360
They can still say goodbye.

692
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:31,326
I just wanted to give him
the chance to talk to them.

693
00:26:37,293 --> 00:26:38,526
How is she?

694
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,060
Oh, good.

695
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:41,460
The pole nicked her liver.

696
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,193
We repaired the defect
with very little blood loss.

697
00:26:44,226 --> 00:26:46,393
‐ Good. Thanks.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

698
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
Hi.

699
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:51,926
Hi.

700
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,526
I called family services
and they're gonna watch Bruce

701
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
until you can get someone
to pick him up.

702
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,093
How's he doing?

703
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,393
He's asleep.

704
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:04,126
Thank you.

705
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,126
I'm, um..

706
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,193
I'm sorry
about what happened downstairs.

707
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,593
You don't need to explain.
I understand.

708
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,593
It wasn't because
of the HIV status.

709
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,026
I was afraid
of the CMV.

710
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,626
Really, you don't
need to explain.

711
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,126
Is that yours?

712
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,293
Yeah.

713
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,026
Time for your medication?

714
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,093
Do you have it here?

715
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:32,493
They're at home.

716
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,560
Well, um, I can
get it for you here.

717
00:27:35,593 --> 00:27:36,926
No.

718
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,226
Thank you.

719
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,326
Um..

720
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,060
Missing a dose could make it
harder to treat the HIV.

721
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:48,626
I'm done with them.

722
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,160
I'm sorry?

723
00:27:50,193 --> 00:27:52,593
I'm not going to take
anymore medicine.

724
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,226
It's not worth it.
I can't function.

725
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,426
Andrea..

726
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,093
...I know
you're upset right now

727
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:02,393
but if you don't take
your medication, the chances‐‐

728
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:04,526
I know what it means.

729
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,293
Bruce is eight.

730
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:11,060
He needs a mother.

731
00:28:11,093 --> 00:28:16,160
It is more important that he
have a well mother for now

732
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,193
than a sick one for longer.

733
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,393
'Good work, Lizzie.'

734
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:26,460
What do you think?

735
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:28,260
I give her 50‐50.

736
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:29,526
Robert, have you
got a minute?

737
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,060
Uh...sure.
You got her, Lizzie?

738
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:33,126
Yeah.

739
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,293
Look, I want
to do this now.

740
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:38,060
Where are you
on this Trauma Fellowship?

741
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,460
Well, like I've
already told you

742
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,393
I don't really see the need,
but if I'm the minority

743
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:42,426
I vote for the Georgetown guy.

744
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,593
Kerry?

745
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:45,893
Peter Benton's
the strongest candidate.

746
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,226
‐ Mark?
‐ I disagree.

747
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,393
Elizabeth Corday
brought us the idea.

748
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:51,226
She has passion
and certainly the talent.

749
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,526
Of course, she does,
but I don't wanna see

750
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,160
either one of them wasted
on this, no offense.

751
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:56,493
They both applied,
didn't they?

752
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,260
Well, it looks like
you're all of separate minds.

753
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:00,593
It's late,
and I want to go home

754
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,493
so I'm gonna
make this quick.

755
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:05,060
Peter Benton it is.
Thank you.

756
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,526
‐ How's he doing?
‐ Pulse ox 92.

757
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,360
Could you get
Dr. Carter?

758
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,526
Sure.

759
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,393
Travis, are you awake?

760
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,093
The doctor needs to put
a tube down your throat

761
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:37,193
to help you breathe now.

762
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:41,493
‐ Can you talk?
‐ Yes.

763
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,026
I have your parents
on the phone

764
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,526
and they're in a car
on their way here.

765
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,593
I thought you might
want to talk to them first.

766
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:54,393
How long?

767
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,960
They should be here
in about 45 minutes

768
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:57,226
but we can't wait that long.

769
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,460
How long's the tube
gonna be in?

770
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,026
At least a few days.

771
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,193
Are you ready?

772
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:09,360
Okay.

773
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:20,426
Mr. Mitchell?

774
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,393
Okay, you can talk to him now.

775
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,426
Okay. Okay, Travis,
it's okay, okay.

776
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,993
There you go.

777
00:30:36,026 --> 00:30:40,560
Hey. Hey. Hey, dad.

778
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:45,060
I know. I know.
I can't believe it.

779
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,093
Did the doctor tell you?

780
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,860
It's‐it's pretty bad.

781
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,426
I don't think I'm gonna,
um..

782
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,460
...I don't think
I'm gonna make it

783
00:30:57,493 --> 00:30:59,493
out to the lake this summer.

784
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:09,293
I don't know,
they‐they took her into surgery.

785
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,593
I haven't heard anything yet.

786
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:16,126
Hey, hey..

787
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,893
Hey, they have
to put this, uh..

788
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,593
...this tube in me,
so I'm not gonna be able to..

789
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,993
...talk for a couple of days.

790
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:28,160
Okay, I'll‐I'll,
I'll see you when you get here.

791
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,593
Hey...mom.

792
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:42,766
You....gotta hang in,
gotta hang in there.

793
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,133
I'm‐I'm okay.
I mean, just a little..

794
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,166
I‐I...I love,
I love you, too.

795
00:31:58,133 --> 00:31:59,733
Pulse ox 89.

796
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,566
Draw up four of Versed
and ten of Norcuron

797
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
insert with the angular tip.

798
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,566
Number eight ET Tube.

799
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:11,666
Okay, Travis..

800
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,100
...you're gonna
feel a little sleepy.

801
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,800
When you wake up,
there's gonna be

802
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,133
a ventilator
helping you breathe.

803
00:32:29,918 --> 00:32:31,785
Hey.

804
00:32:31,818 --> 00:32:35,418
It's not
a very encouraging entrance.

805
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:36,785
I'm sorry.

806
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,818
You didn't get
the Trauma Fellowship.

807
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:43,785
Is it Peter?

808
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:45,152
Yeah.

809
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:48,885
Well, that's that, then.

810
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:51,318
I was looking forward
to working with you.

811
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,285
Yeah. Same here.

812
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,352
So now what?

813
00:32:58,385 --> 00:32:59,785
Well, I guess I'm left
to ferret around

814
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:03,918
picking up scraps
wherever I can find them.

815
00:33:03,952 --> 00:33:05,785
It doesn't mean Peter
was a better candidate.

816
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,685
Oh, I know.

817
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:14,252
How much more time
do you have on your internship?

818
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,252
Three weeks.

819
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,952
Well, you have
your license.

820
00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:19,618
You can do
anything you want.

821
00:33:19,652 --> 00:33:21,685
Except the Trauma Fellowship.

822
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:23,285
Just about anything.

823
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,718
How did the voting go?

824
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,485
I think you know.

825
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:32,318
Yeah. Romano didn't
want either of us.

826
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:34,952
Anspaugh was keen on Benton.
Don't tell me you were.

827
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:37,218
No, I wanted you.

828
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:39,185
But I'm not
really objective.

829
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,518
Really?

830
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:48,718
‐ You know what you need?
‐ What?

831
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:51,452
A milkshake.
When time do you get off?

832
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:52,785
Midnight.

833
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:55,785
Okay. I'll find you.

834
00:33:55,818 --> 00:33:58,585
Is this more of
your bad‐day therapy?

835
00:33:58,618 --> 00:34:01,252
It's free of charge.

836
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,618
I'm sorry.

837
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:11,818
What about the place
up the street?

838
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,618
No, you don't want
to go there.

839
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,418
Excuse me.

840
00:34:17,985 --> 00:34:19,852
‐ Hey, who is that?
‐ Who?

841
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:22,185
‐ Over there, talking to Chuny.
‐ I don't know.

842
00:34:22,218 --> 00:34:23,885
‐ She works in Urology.
‐ Really?

843
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,385
Carter, are you on
for a while?

844
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,818
Yeah, another six hours.

845
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:28,885
Got a social worker coming
from the HIV Clinic.

846
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,685
Needs to see
a patient upstairs.

847
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:32,385
‐ Surgical ward?
‐ Sure.

848
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,385
‐ Randi, did you get that?
‐ Uh, yeah.

849
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:36,185
‐ HIV Clinic to Carter.
‐ Goodnight.

850
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:38,318
ER.
Yeah, she's right here.

851
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,918
Carol...Doug.

852
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:43,952
I'll, uh, I'll get it
in the lounge.

853
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:46,618
‐ Hey, Chuny.
‐ What?

854
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,952
Is that the same friend
that you were talking about?

855
00:34:48,985 --> 00:34:50,585
You're too late
now, Carter.

856
00:34:50,618 --> 00:34:51,852
What, there was
a time limit?

857
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:53,418
I didn't think
you were that shallow.

858
00:34:53,452 --> 00:34:55,485
No. I'm just reconsidering
your proposal.

859
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:57,818
‐ You snooze, you lose.
‐ Snooze, you lose.

860
00:34:57,852 --> 00:34:59,352
What are we,
in tenth grade?

861
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,918
I set her up
with an Orthopedics intern.

862
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,485
An intern?

863
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,618
I'll tell you what,
if you're nice

864
00:35:04,652 --> 00:35:07,252
I'll try to get her
to reconsider.

865
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:08,618
Adios.

866
00:35:08,652 --> 00:35:10,218
Lucy, the pharmacy called.

867
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:11,718
‐ Your prescription is ready.
‐ Thanks.

868
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:12,852
‐ You're sick?
‐ No.

869
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,552
‐ What is it then?
‐ Nothing.

870
00:35:14,585 --> 00:35:16,718
‐ Why are you on medication?
‐ Why are you so nosy?

871
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:20,485
‐ Who prescribed it?
‐ It's none of your business.

872
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,185
Yeah, this morning
I saw you were exhausted.

873
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:25,685
Then you pop some pill
and suddenly you are fine

874
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:27,385
‐ Now you're dragging again.
‐ I'm not on speed.

875
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:28,418
If that's what
you're asking, Carter.

876
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:30,618
So what is it?
Huh, what is it?

877
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:32,185
Ritalin. Okay?
I'm on Ritalin.

878
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:33,318
Ritalin? Since when?

879
00:35:33,352 --> 00:35:35,285
‐ Fifth grade.
‐ What?

880
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:37,218
Yeah, my doctor tried to get me
off it in high school

881
00:35:37,252 --> 00:35:38,552
and my grades dropped,
so I went back on.

882
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:40,285
You've been on it
ever since?

883
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:43,652
Well, there's never really been
a good time to stop.

884
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:45,718
Now. Now would be
a good time to stop.

885
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,285
I'm not an addict, Carter.

886
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:49,285
Lucy, you shouldn't still
be taking it.

887
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,618
‐ It's a stimulant.
‐ I don't take it to get high.

888
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,352
‐ I take it to function.
‐ You got ADD?

889
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,685
And it's never really
been a problem

890
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,585
until I started working
so many nights.

891
00:35:57,618 --> 00:36:00,518
Ritalin is for
hyperactive children. You're 24.

892
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:01,818
And my doctor still
prescribes it

893
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,218
so I'm not doing
anything wrong.

894
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:04,685
You're just gonna keep
taking it forever?

895
00:36:04,718 --> 00:36:06,952
I'll stop taking it
when things are less hectic.

896
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:08,818
Got news for you.
Things are never less hectic.

897
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:10,452
I'll think about it, alright?

898
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,818
But this really
is my business, Carter.

899
00:36:12,852 --> 00:36:14,818
And I hope
you'll respect that.

900
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:19,718
'The signer's head leans
to the right'

901
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:24,852
'and rests in the upturned palm
of the open right hand.'

902
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,618
Hey.

903
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,652
Hey.

904
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,752
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

905
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:33,418
Look, Elizabeth..

906
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:35,718
...you don't have to say that.

907
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:39,585
Peter, I'm just trying
to be gracious.

908
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:40,885
Thank you.

909
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,485
Peter.

910
00:36:45,518 --> 00:36:48,252
Elizabeth, would you
excuse us, please?

911
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,518
Certainly.

912
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:51,285
Thank you.

913
00:36:53,585 --> 00:36:55,218
You do lack
some qualities, Peter

914
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,918
but I always considered you
a man of your word.

915
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:58,385
I never said I'd take it.

916
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,785
You said
you wanted cardiothoracic.

917
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,852
No. I said
I was interested.

918
00:37:09,285 --> 00:37:11,252
You missed your calling, Peter.
You should've been a lawyer.

919
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:14,718
I couldn't count on it.

920
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:17,252
I told you that I would be
pushing for you. I have been.

921
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,918
Thank you, but I'm taking
the Trauma Fellowship, okay?

922
00:37:22,552 --> 00:37:25,585
Fine. Whatever, Peter.
I'm done looking out for you.

923
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,185
You wanna throw your life
down the toilet.

924
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:28,885
‐ That's your prerogative.
‐ Yeah, it is.

925
00:37:28,918 --> 00:37:30,452
Just don't come crying
to me when you realize

926
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:32,452
what a mistake you've made.

927
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,752
‐ Were you serious?
‐ What?

928
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:37,718
The offer you made today,
were you serious?

929
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:43,385
Dr. Greene, some weird guy
dropped this off for you.

930
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:46,452
‐ What is it?
‐ Do I read your mail?

931
00:37:46,485 --> 00:37:48,452
"Thanks for patching up Amber."

932
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,185
‐ 'Who's Amber?'
‐ Well, she's a stripper.

933
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:52,952
Whoa.
Must've liked you a lot.

934
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:55,352
‐ How much is there?
‐ Looks like about two grand.

935
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:56,952
Whoo! Party.

936
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,885
Look, Randi, get out
the phone book.

937
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:02,185
Look up FBI and have them
come pick this up.

938
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:07,252
Excuse me?
Uh, I'm Greg Mitchell.

939
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,252
Our son and daughter
were in an accident.

940
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:15,652
I'm Dr. Greene.

941
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,718
I saw both of them here
in the Emergency Department.

942
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:20,352
Well, where are they?

943
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:22,818
Shannon underwent surgery.

944
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:24,685
There was a broken vertebrae
in her back

945
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,518
that was impinging
on her spinal cord.

946
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:28,685
But she's gonna be okay?

947
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:30,385
There's a possibility

948
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,718
that she'll lose function
below her waist.

949
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:35,252
Oh, God.

950
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:36,718
Travis suffered
third‐degree burns

951
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:38,685
over the majority
of his body.

952
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,885
Third degree?

953
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,752
He's up in the Burn Unit.

954
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:45,485
They're doing everything
they can

955
00:38:45,518 --> 00:38:48,752
to make him as comfortable
as possible.

956
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,718
But I have to tell you that
with burns of this magnitude

957
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,918
the survival rate is very low.

958
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:01,552
Is he gonna die?

959
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:03,918
He has a 20% chance
of survival.

960
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:05,785
Oh! Oh, God.

961
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:07,918
Oh! Oh, God! No!

962
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:09,485
No!

963
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:10,518
No!

964
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:34,452
You're up.

965
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:39,252
‐ Where am I?
‐ The OR Recovery Room.

966
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,618
We operated on your back.
You were in a car accident.

967
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:42,918
'Do you remember?'

968
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,652
I thought it was a dream.

969
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,618
Can I do a quick test?

970
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:58,485
'I want you to tell me when
you feel something, alright?'

971
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:07,818
'Shannon?'

972
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:09,518
'Are you with me?'

973
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:10,685
Yeah.

974
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:14,185
There.

975
00:40:14,218 --> 00:40:15,885
What does that mean?

976
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:18,152
It's no better.
It's no worse.

977
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:22,818
Let's see how
your big toe's doing, shall we?

978
00:40:27,652 --> 00:40:30,318
I want you to wiggle it
just like you did before.

979
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:31,318
'Alright?'

980
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:37,385
Again.

981
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:43,318
'Is it moving?'

982
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,585
Let's just wait and see.

983
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:49,785
The swelling has
to come down first.

984
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,885
Lily, I took
Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell

985
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,352
up to the Burn Unit.

986
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,552
Could you go up
and show one of them

987
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:57,652
to Surgical Recovery?

988
00:40:57,685 --> 00:40:58,752
‐ Sure.
‐ Thanks.

989
00:40:58,785 --> 00:41:00,952
Um, Mark,
I wouldn't go in there.

990
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:02,185
Why?

991
00:41:02,218 --> 00:41:03,785
We're giving Carol some space.

992
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:05,285
Doug called.

993
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,185
Carol?

994
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:16,485
Go away, Mark.

995
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,518
Did you tell him?

996
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:26,452
He's not coming.

997
00:41:31,618 --> 00:41:33,618
Did you ask him
not to come?

998
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:34,718
Yeah.

999
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:39,852
I was very strong...and clear.

1000
00:41:41,985 --> 00:41:43,818
So he's respecting
your wishes?

1001
00:41:45,818 --> 00:41:48,252
That would be a first time,
wouldn't it?

1002
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,718
You wanted him to come.

1003
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:57,818
No.

1004
00:42:02,385 --> 00:42:07,485
I've had...hundreds
of conversations with him

1005
00:42:07,518 --> 00:42:09,452
in my head, you know?

1006
00:42:11,852 --> 00:42:14,418
What I would say,
what I would..

1007
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:16,518
...do if he showed up.

1008
00:42:18,518 --> 00:42:21,552
I wouldn't let him charm
his way back in.

1009
00:42:21,585 --> 00:42:22,885
Not now.

1010
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:26,352
Not because of the baby.

1011
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:34,618
I would never feel secure

1012
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,885
knowing that that's why
he came back.

1013
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:42,585
Maybe he feels the same way.

1014
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:52,218
I still expected him to come.

1015
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,852
I've got to go home.

1016
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:04,585
Hmm...you know what you need?

1017
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:05,752
What?

1018
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,252
What?

1019
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:11,585
You need a milkshake.

1020
00:43:11,618 --> 00:43:14,552
Elizabeth and I are going
to go get a milkshake.

1021
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:15,885
Why don't you come?

1022
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:17,885
No. I'm tired
and I'm gonna go home.

1023
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,685
No, no, just, just one

1024
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:22,752
one little milkshake, okay?

1025
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:24,485
It was a date, wasn't it?

1026
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,485
Look, no, it wasn't a,
it wasn't a date.

1027
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:31,318
Well, um, we were just going to
drown our sorrows in ice cream.

1028
00:43:31,352 --> 00:43:32,585
'Come on.'

1029
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:35,385
I don't wanna be
a third wheel, Mark.

1030
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:37,752
How many times
have I been a third wheel?

1031
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:42,352
That's true.
You do owe me.

1032
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:48,718
That's the spirit.

1033
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,518
Are you paying?

1034
00:43:50,552 --> 00:43:51,785
Of course I'm paying.

1035
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:53,752
'Cause I'm eating
for two, you know.
