1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,066
Previously on ER.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,733
It'd be remiss if
I didn't offer up my services.

3
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:11,200
Yeah, burns seem
to be well healed.

4
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,300
Wanna tell me how it happened?

5
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,133
We put the patient first

6
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,700
and that's what
we're supposed to do.

7
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,533
Anytime you want to prescribe
schedule two narcotics

8
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,166
we want to co‐sign the order.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,533
You should agree
for something called, uh, PCA.

10
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:24,300
Hook Ricky up to an IV.

11
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,733
That would deliver pain
medication to him at home.

12
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,500
They need you to sign off
on the Dilaudid.

13
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,766
Yeah, I can't sign off on that,
he's not on our service.

14
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,433
Hey.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,033
Doug..

16
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,666
Hi.

17
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,533
‐ What time is it, huh?
‐ It's almost 6.

18
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:24,100
It's very strong.

19
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,600
How's Ricky?

20
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:28,533
He's still alive.

21
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:32,400
‐ How's Joi?
‐ She's not so good.

22
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:35,800
It's amazing he made
it through the night.

23
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:39,200
I've got to get to work.
What time's your shift?

24
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,500
Seven.

25
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,200
I'll see you there.

26
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,033
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye.

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,466
Doug..

28
00:01:54,466 --> 00:01:55,533
Hmm?

29
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,533
Thanks.

30
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:02,066
For what?

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,700
For staying last night.

32
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,300
Hey.

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,366
I love this time
of night, just before dawn.

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,533
So quiet, peaceful.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,600
When they're babies,
it's the best time.

36
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:54,533
You complain about it but..

37
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:57,033
...it's when you're
closest to them.

38
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,733
Singing to them
in the dark and nursing.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,533
Did you get any sleep?

40
00:03:05,566 --> 00:03:07,666
I must have.

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,800
I closed my eyes for
a moment and he was laughing.

42
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,800
He was getting up
to go to school.

43
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,266
He was kidding me
about how much I worry.

44
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,266
He always used to do that.

45
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,366
Try to cheer me up,
make me laugh.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,133
Oh, God.

47
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,766
‐ When was his last booster?
‐ About an hour ago.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
They won't give me any more.

49
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,166
Mommy..

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,433
Go back to sleep, sweetheart.

51
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:43,066
I'm thirsty.

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,700
I'll get you a drink
of water, okay?

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,066
It's okay, buddy.

54
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,700
I'll take care of you.

55
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,166
'Dr. Ross?'

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,766
I increased the Dilaudid.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,633
It's going to make it more
difficult for him to breathe.

58
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,100
I..

59
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:24,200
I don't know h..

60
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,166
...how much more
of this I can take.

61
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,433
Would you please..

62
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,166
...help us?

63
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:39,533
Please.

64
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,766
I..

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,333
...I can't watch
him suffer anymore.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,200
He's suffered enough.

67
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,666
No more.

68
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,400
No more.

69
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,566
'Our recent spring‐like
temperatures'

70
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,600
'will be a thing of the past'

71
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,366
'by early afternoon..'

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,466
Ah, man, I'm supposed to be
going ice fishing tonight.

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Ice fishing?

74
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,533
Al and I are supposed to be

75
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:03,233
driving up to Wisconsin to ski.

76
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:05,433
Skiing in Wisconsin?
That's an oxymoron, isn't it?

77
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,300
No, cross‐country.
You should try it.

78
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,333
‐ It's great exercise.
‐ Uh, you're the moron.

79
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:10,766
Sitting on lake Michigan

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,433
in the middle of winter
with your little pole.

81
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,666
"Oxymoron."
It's a figure of speech

82
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,300
in which opposite
or contradictory

83
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,766
terms or ideas
are combined.

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,166
I know what it means,
I just think you're a fool

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,033
for freezing your butt
off out on a lake.

86
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:24,166
Who gave him that damn
"Improve Your Vocabulary"

87
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,300
calendar in the first place?

88
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,200
I did.
Broadens his horizons.

89
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,266
What's today's word, Jerry?

90
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,266
Uh, today's word..

91
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,166
...is..

92
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,566
"Ratio...cination."

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,366
Oh, yeah, that's
going to come in handy

94
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,066
in daily conversation.

95
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,233
Uh, has anyone seen Carol?

96
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:43,800
It's ratiocination.

97
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,633
And it's to reckon, to reason

98
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,366
especially to reason
using formal logic.

99
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,533
Jesuit High School.

100
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,100
Hathaway's in sutures.

101
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:55,400
'You're kidding, Rocket Romano?'

102
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah, it's only temporary
until your committee

103
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,500
finds a permanent
department head.

104
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:02,333
‐ Why Romano?
‐ What? What about Romano?

105
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:04,300
Anspaugh's made him
acting chief.

106
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,666
Of emergency
medicine?

107
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,633
Hey, I'm not happy
about it either.

108
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,500
He's an egotistical,
arrogant, mean‐spirited

109
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,066
sexist little
bullet‐head.

110
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,133
Good morning, doctors.

111
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,266
News of my recent appointment
precedes me, I take it?

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,600
What, no popping
of champagne?

113
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,300
No, uh, ticker tape?

114
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,066
Excuse me.
I have a patient.

115
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,066
Looking forward to working
together again, Maggie.

116
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,400
I took the
liberty of reassigning

117
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:29,366
a few
minor tasks.

118
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,166
Greene, you'll handle
chart review

119
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,766
resident and medical
student supervision

120
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,466
time card scheduling
and any patient complaints.

121
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,733
Dr. Weaver.

122
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,166
Joint commission
report is due.

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,533
And I'd like
a weekly census

124
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,800
divided into surgery,
pedes and medicine.

125
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,133
I'd also like a daily list of
consults and their outcomes.

126
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,666
You'll sit on
the budget committee

127
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,766
and handle all billing questions
and insurance approvals.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
What do you do?

129
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,700
I supervise you.

130
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,800
Delegation...one
of the eight hallmarks

131
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,233
of effective leadership,
or didn't you read that book?

132
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:59,400
Well, if you need me,
I'll be in surgery.

133
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:00,533
Oh, um..

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,300
Bullet‐head.

135
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,233
I'm offended.

136
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,266
Aren't you, Dr. Greene?

137
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,533
Deeply, deeply wounded

138
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,533
by your callous
and uncaring remark.

139
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,800
In fact, I‐I might have
to start an investigation

140
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,433
and interview others
who might have been hurt

141
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:22,100
by your vicious
invective in the past.

142
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,366
This is going to be fun.

143
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,700
Doug.

144
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,066
Just get his coat
and sweater off.

145
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,500
‐ I'll be right in.
‐ Okay.

146
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:37,100
That two year old eats nothing
but French fries and pizza.

147
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:40,466
The mom doesn't understand
why he's constipated.

148
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,566
So how was Ricky
when you left?

149
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,500
Alive.

150
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,500
I better get going,
I'm behind already.

151
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:51,166
‐ Lunch?
‐ Sure.

152
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
You sure look beautiful.

153
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,366
How do you do that
without any sleep?

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,433
Good genes.

155
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,533
You look like hell.

156
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,300
‐ It's a chick flick.
‐ It's romantic.

157
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,166
Isn't it, like,
four hours long?

158
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,266
Yeah, but the special
effects are great.

159
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,366
Kate Winslet
gets naked.

160
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,100
Oh, well,
that's encouraging.

161
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:10,433
‐ What you got?
‐ Fender bender. Tender abdomen.

162
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,800
You ever seen
"Titanic", Carter?

163
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,500
‐ Nope. Chick flick.
‐ That's what I said.

164
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,533
Lucy just rented it,
wants me to watch it with her.

165
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,033
Leonardo DiCaprio,
hoopskirts and tragic love

166
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,366
is kind of my idea
of hell on earth.

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,800
You guys are
Neanderthals.

168
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,800
Whatever happened to
the sensitive 90's male?

169
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,033
The ones who love romantic
dinners and candlelight.

170
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,400
They're all gay,
aren't they, Carter?

171
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,066
Every last one.
Listen, I don't want to ruin

172
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,533
the movie for you, Dale,
but in the end, the ship sinks.

173
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,333
I hate you both.

174
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,033
Nice package, huh?

175
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,433
So you two
getting serious?

176
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:42,433
She is.

177
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,366
Um...have you two..

178
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Consummated?

179
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,800
I couldn't discuss it if I had.

180
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,533
I wouldn't want to
damage Lucy's reputation.

181
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,066
Tell you this
much, though..

182
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,766
...thongs.

183
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,466
Don't take my word for it.

184
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,433
When the lighting's right,
you can see through her scrubs.

185
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,333
E...S..

186
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:07,733
Make it a little rounder.

187
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:10,133
Yeah. E.

188
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,200
Reese.

189
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,733
‐ That's hard.
‐ You'll get the hang of it.

190
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:19,633
How long will it take?

191
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,800
Oh, it depends on
how much you practice.

192
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,633
You're learning
a new language.

193
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,233
Reese is already
getting it.

194
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:28,566
Oh, he's a kid.
It's easier.

195
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,233
He wants
to communicate.

196
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:32,333
Yeah.

197
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,733
That's it for today.

198
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,266
‐ Um...how often should we..?
‐ You and me?

199
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,033
Oh, I would recommend
three times a week.

200
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,200
150 bucks a week?

201
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,033
There's good
video available

202
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:51,000
but, I think
one on one is better.

203
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Mr. Ekabo, how are you?

204
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,733
Fine.

205
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:00,200
How did it go
at the urologist?

206
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:04,666
Did you see the doctor?

207
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah, everything's good.

208
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,466
Say, if you have any
questions about a procedure

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,300
or what the doctor's telling you

210
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,766
I'd be happy
to answer them.

211
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:21,000
Huh, no questions, no.

212
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:27,600
You didn't go
see the urologist

213
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,133
did you, Mr. Ekabo?

214
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,066
'Why not?'

215
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,533
I've not told my wife
about my needing a doctor.

216
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,533
She will be frightened.

217
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,400
Would you like me
to explain it to her?

218
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:50,633
You will do that?

219
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,166
I'd be happy to.

220
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,700
Dr. Greene..

221
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,100
we've got an eight‐year‐old
coming in, full arrest.

222
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,433
‐ 'How long?'
‐ Coming up now.

223
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,033
Uh, bring your wife around.

224
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,566
'We'll talk.'

225
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,433
Then we can go ahead and, uh..

226
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,400
...set up that
urologist appointment.

227
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,066
Okay?

228
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,733
Where's that bad‐ass snow
we're supposed to be getting?

229
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,700
‐ It's summertime out here.
‐ You know what they say..

230
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,133
"It's the calm
before the storm."

231
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,300
Eight year old male found
unresponsive in bed at home.

232
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,466
Asystole, began CPR
in the field.

233
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,766
‐ Joi?
‐ What do we got?

234
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,066
Uh, end stage ALD.
He's Doug's patient.

235
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,333
‐ How long has he been down?
‐ Don't know.

236
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:31,566
We scooped him up
15 minutes ago.

237
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,166
He wasn't expected to
make it through the night.

238
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,333
His mother wanted
him to die at home.

239
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:38,533
Joi, why did you
call the paramedics?

240
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:40,166
‐ 'I didn't.'
‐ Mrs. Abbott.

241
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,733
Do you want us to use
extraordinary measures

242
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,066
to keep your son alive?

243
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,333
‐ No, I don't.
‐ But I do.

244
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,366
'Who are you?'

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,133
Ricky's father.

246
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,033
Sir, your son is
at the end stages

247
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,633
of a painful
terminal illness.

248
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,500
Extending his life is only
going to prolong his agony.

249
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,600
Doctor, please don't
let him die.

250
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,333
Intubation kit.

251
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
‐ Her leg isn't broken..
‐ Doug, I need you.

252
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,633
They're much tougher
than you think.

253
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,500
Yeah?

254
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,100
Ricky Abbott's back
and his father

255
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,366
is insisting we try
and resuscitate him.

256
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
His father?

257
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,600
Carol, what meds
is he on?

258
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,600
‐ Car...where's Carol?
‐ She left to go get Doug.

259
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,533
'He's on Dilaudid for the pain.'

260
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,600
Two milligrams of Narcan.

261
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:24,033
Chuny, why don't you take
Mr. And Mrs. Abbott to chairs.

262
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,533
What's going on?

263
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,800
Mr. Abbott asked us to try
to resuscitate his son.

264
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,600
‐ Still flat line.
‐ Atropine and two of epi.

265
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,633
He shouldn't have made
it through the night.

266
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,500
‐ Who the hell are you?
‐ I'm Dr. Ross.

267
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,766
Look, he was in my care..

268
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
Son of a bitch!

269
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,333
'Get him out of here.'

270
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,366
Get him out of here!

271
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,766
Get your hands off me.

272
00:13:42,566 --> 00:13:43,700
Still flat line.

273
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:47,100
Oh, please.

274
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:51,100
Please.

275
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,633
Sorry, Mr. Abbott.

276
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,700
Time of death, 9:42.

277
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,666
You're actually going
to need a couple of sutures.

278
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,266
Want me to get
plastics down here?

279
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,700
You can do it.

280
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:22,466
So, what the hell
was that all about?

281
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,533
I have no idea, I didn't
even know there was a father.

282
00:14:24,566 --> 00:14:26,033
Is he going
to be okay?

283
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,066
Couple of stitches to
add to his rugged charm.

284
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,433
How's Mike Tyson?

285
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:30,466
He went to make a phone call.

286
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,233
Took the little girl with him.

287
00:14:32,266 --> 00:14:34,533
Did Joi ever mention there was
a father in the picture?

288
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:37,466
She told me
they were separated.

289
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,666
You went down
like a brick.

290
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,066
Cheap shot. The guy
caught me off‐balance.

291
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,433
I didn't realize
you had such a glass jaw.

292
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,200
Child support,
my med school loans..

293
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:49,166
Man, I don't know how
I'm going to shake it.

294
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,333
'And how much do you
have to pay in school loans?'

295
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,366
Uh, over 120 grand.

296
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,166
'Oh, that's barbaric!'

297
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,733
'Oh, well, yeah,
payment's $700 a month.'

298
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,233
'That's a quarter
of my take‐home pay.'

299
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,566
Money woes, Peter?

300
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,366
Every resident's
chief complaint.

301
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,700
You know, I'll never understand
this country's insistence

302
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,766
on forcing its
highly trained residents

303
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,066
to live
in abject poverty.

304
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,333
'And slave labor.'

305
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,766
Only way the public
health system can afford

306
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,500
to provide care for all
the, uh, freeloaders.

307
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,133
By freeloaders,
you mean people without

308
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,366
educational
opportunities, job training

309
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,266
children and the infirm.

310
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,433
Yeah, like I said.

311
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,500
Freeloaders.

312
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:23,333
You're a despicable human being.

313
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:25,566
Do you know that?

314
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,400
So, having trouble
making ends meet?

315
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,333
Things are a little
tight right now.

316
00:15:29,366 --> 00:15:31,800
Why don't you do what I did?
Apply to a locum tenens program.

317
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,233
A "locum" what?

318
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,300
Tenens. Filling in
for vacationing surgeons

319
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,533
in rural hospitals
in, uh, Minnesota

320
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:39,366
the Dakotas
on your vacation time.

321
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,166
These places don't have
enough staff to cover

322
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,266
when somebody's out and they
pay you a bundle to step in.

323
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,133
‐ Oh, yeah? What's a bundle?
‐ I don't know.

324
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,666
Eight, ten grand
for a couple weeks.

325
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
Where's the big storm?

326
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,800
Should be any minute now.

327
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,300
They're closing
all those schools at lunch.

328
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,233
Recommending people leave early.

329
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:58,366
They really emphasized
that last point..

330
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
...the importance
of people leaving early

331
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,266
so they can
get home safely.

332
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,666
No, Jerry.

333
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,766
‐ The national weather service‐‐
‐ I said no, Jerry.

334
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,266
Spoke with Anspaugh
this morning.

335
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,333
He said it might be months

336
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,400
before we get a new chief.

337
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,233
Months with Romano?

338
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:11,466
Did we do
something heinous

339
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,266
in a past life
to deserve this?

340
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,733
There's Viking
in my family.

341
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,633
Maybe I raped
and pillaged Northern Europe.

342
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,733
Pillaged? Cool.

343
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:18,766
You must've looked great

344
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
in one of those big horned hats.

345
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:22,300
Maybe you
should consider

346
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,766
reapplying for
the chief's job.

347
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,100
Once foolish,
twice stupid.

348
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,500
Don might entertain
renewed interest.

349
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,800
I spoke to him about
you this morning.

350
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,433
Really?
Oh, God, I don't know

351
00:16:31,466 --> 00:16:33,166
if I could go through
all that again.

352
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,800
Can I at least tell him
that you seemed interested?

353
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,633
How about intrigued?

354
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,166
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Mr. Abbott.

355
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,333
‐ Who?
‐ Richard Abbott.

356
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,266
His son Ricky died
here this morning.

357
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
‐ Um..
‐ Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.

358
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,200
I was with Mr. Abbott earlier
but I haven't seen him around.

359
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,033
I'm Dan Sullivan,
I work with Richard

360
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:50,666
down at the state
attorney's office.

361
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,300
He's asked us to open
an investigation

362
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,166
into the circumstances
surrounding his son's death.

363
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,600
Have the police arrived yet?

364
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,533
‐ Hey.
‐ How are you?

365
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:11,166
I'm fine.

366
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm sorry Richard hit you.

367
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,733
We've been...separated
since Michael died.

368
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,666
I called him yesterday
to tell him that Ricky..

369
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,466
That, that he should
probably try to come see him.

370
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,166
He was at a...a conference
in Houston so I left a message

371
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,066
and when he arrived
this morning..

372
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,033
...and saw that Ricky was gone,
he kind of lost it.

373
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:41,733
He just wasn't ready.

374
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:44,533
Joi.

375
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,366
It's time for you
to let the nurses

376
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,333
finish up with Ricky.

377
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,100
‐ You made arrangements for him?
‐ Oh, um..

378
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,766
I‐I think I'll go
to the same funeral home

379
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,666
that took care
of Michael.

380
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,200
I'll call them.

381
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:13,466
Give me the number, I'll call.

382
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,166
Thanks.

383
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,766
Doug, got a moment?

384
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,433
Yeah.

385
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,433
What's up?

386
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:30,100
The police are here.

387
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:32,466
Mr. Abbott is accusing
you of murdering his son.

388
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,333
She was hit in the face
while kickboxing.

389
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,433
Not kickboxing. Tae‐bo class.

390
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,633
It's like aerobics,
but only better.

391
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,233
Hey, I heard about that.

392
00:18:44,266 --> 00:18:45,633
It's supposed to be
good for losing weight.

393
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,400
‐ Yeah, I lost 16 pounds.
‐ 16 pounds, wow.

394
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,166
I had everybody in the
class spread out enough

395
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,733
but this new guy shows up
and she got kicked.

396
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,433
Did you lose
consciousness?

397
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,800
No, but I was pretty dizzy.

398
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,566
How long did it take
you to lose the weight?

399
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,433
Just melted off.

400
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:02,266
Hope this won't keep me
from getting back to class.

401
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,766
Fundus is sharp.

402
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,400
No papilledema.

403
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:08,066
‐ Want to palpate the orbit?
‐ No, that's okay.

404
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,333
‐ Is it expensive?
‐ Not too bad.

405
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,466
It's worth it.

406
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,566
You feel this?

407
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,100
Mm, yes.

408
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,433
Any numbness?

409
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:15,766
‐ No.
‐ Do you have early classes?

410
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,233
I usually have
to be here by 7.

411
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:18,500
Any visual changes?

412
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,533
Shapes, things
out of focus?

413
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:24,233
I teach a 5:30 class, if you
buy 20, you get five free.

414
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,800
‐ No kidding?
‐ Anybody know where a phone is?

415
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,566
Yeah, there's a pay phone
right over there.

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,033
No step off. I'm concerned
about your blurred vision.

417
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:31,433
So let's get
some facial films

418
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:33,066
and a visual acuity.

419
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,633
Lucy, if you think
you can tear yourself away

420
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,533
from fitness bargain hunting
for five minutes, stitch her up.

421
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,433
Your wish is my command,
Dr. Carter.

422
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,666
Irrigate and suture.

423
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,466
Hey, I don't usually get
a lunch break, so I end up

424
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,800
eating out of the
vending machines

425
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,066
and it's hard
to keep the pounds off.

426
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,166
First Lidocaine to numb the area

427
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,500
and then you'll feel

428
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,433
a little bit of wetness
as I irrigate the wound.

429
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,666
Dr. Carter.

430
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,733
Yeah.

431
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,266
Uh, the cut's pretty deep.

432
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,266
Should I do a few
subcutaneous first?

433
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,233
Yeah, absolutely.

434
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,733
Well, I'll check back
with you in a little bit.

435
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,633
Was he staring at my ass?

436
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,166
Hmph.

437
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,666
Coroner's coming over to get
the body and do an autopsy.

438
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,800
Roger Julian's coming
down from genetics.

439
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,033
He's hopping mad,
says Ricky was on his service.

440
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,400
Wants to know where the hell

441
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:35,033
the mother got Dilaudid
and a PCA machine.

442
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,200
The boy was dying.

443
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,333
You promised Kerry and I that

444
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,166
you wouldn't
prescribe any more‐‐

445
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,666
‐ He was in excruciating pain.
‐ You promised us yesterday!

446
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,633
‐ The mother was begging me.
‐ Where'd you get the machine?

447
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,266
Genetics didn't prescribe it.
I know we didn't.

448
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,733
I got it from Carol's clinic.

449
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:48,400
Come here.

450
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:53,300
Carol's clinic
doesn't have PCA's.

451
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,533
She called in a favor.

452
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,433
Got it from one
of her suppliers.

453
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:59,433
The police are on their way
to Joi Abbott's house right now.

454
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,733
They have a warrant
to impound the PCA.

455
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,733
Are they going to find
anything out of the ordinary?

456
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,033
Like what?

457
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:06,533
Like the machine
set to administer

458
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,300
enough Dilaudid
to kill ten grown men?

459
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,566
I don't know.

460
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,066
What'd you mean,
you don't know? You set it.

461
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,166
This boy was suffering, Mark.

462
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,533
He had end‐stage ALD.

463
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,433
In agony. The mother was
watching this child die.

464
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:18,766
Did you help him along?

465
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,433
I gave the mother
the entry code.

466
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,266
I showed her how
to change the dosage.

467
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,766
Now, I don't know what she did
afterwards. I went to work.

468
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,066
And you would have
done the exact same thing

469
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,500
if you were there.

470
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,633
Anspaugh's coming down
with Romano and Julian.

471
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,100
Doug prescribed the PCA
machine and the Dilaudid

472
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,166
through Carol's clinic.

473
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,666
What? When?

474
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,033
Right after he told us
he wouldn't.

475
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,300
Uh!

476
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,200
We're going to have
to tell Anspaugh

477
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:40,666
about Doug violating
the pain study protocol

478
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,300
and our covering it up.

479
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,600
I mean they're going
to scrutinize

480
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:45,500
everything he's
prescribed, Mark.

481
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,733
They're going to interview the
mother, it's bound to come out.

482
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,400
What the hell's wrong with you?

483
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,500
I mean, we trusted you
and you immediately choose

484
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,033
'to betray that trust.'

485
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,466
I'm done defending you, Doug.

486
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Defending me? You've been trying
to nail me for years.

487
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,233
'I don't nail colleagues.'

488
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,166
'You want to destroy
your own career? That's fine.'

489
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,300
But you stay the hell
away from mine.

490
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,300
Have you called an attorney?

491
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,166
I don't need an attorney.

492
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,333
It was the right thing
to do, Mark.

493
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,500
Ricky had a degenerative
genetic disorder.

494
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,633
His brother died of the same
disease several years ago.

495
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,700
I have a 16 year old.

496
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,433
I don't know what I'd do
under similar circumstances.

497
00:22:26,466 --> 00:22:28,400
Look, I know
Mr. Abbott is upset

498
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,800
but his son died.

499
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,333
There's nothing Dr. Ross
or any other physician

500
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:34,333
could do about it.

501
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:37,266
This, um, PCA machine..

502
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,800
It delivers um...pain
medication to the patient?

503
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,500
A steady dose
through an IV.

504
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,666
Well, can the, uh, patient,
or the patient's parent

505
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,533
program the machine
to increase the dosage

506
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,133
if the patient
is still in pain?

507
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,400
No. They can give
a booster every hour

508
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,466
but, um, they need
a key or a code

509
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,033
to change the dosage.

510
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:56,433
That way they can't
screw it up.

511
00:22:56,466 --> 00:22:58,200
Well, that's what
I thought, so

512
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,266
I was surprised when
Mrs. Abbott, uh

513
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,266
told her husband Dr. Ross
had given her the code.

514
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,066
And showed her how
to change the dosage

515
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,266
before he left.

516
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,533
Why do you think
he would do that?

517
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,433
You two took it
upon yourselves

518
00:23:11,466 --> 00:23:12,766
'to cover up a serious breach'

519
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,066
of a federally funded program?

520
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,400
We thought it was in
the hospital's best interest

521
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,566
'to keep the incident
from becoming public.'

522
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,366
Well, it's gonna
go public now.

523
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,200
And in connection with
a high‐profile euthanasia case.

524
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,700
Where the hell
did Ross get a PCA?

525
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,233
‐ 'From the clinic.'
‐ God, what a fiasco.

526
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,566
What about Ross?

527
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,233
Take him out back
and shoot him.

528
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,100
We'll convene a meeting
of the disciplinary committee

529
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,666
immediately and begin
an investigation.

530
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,700
You can begin that process
but don't conclude it

531
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,766
until we know whether or not
the father's going to sue.

532
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,433
Ross keeps working?

533
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:45,333
Listen, you can have him
dispense aspirin if you want to.

534
00:23:45,366 --> 00:23:47,500
I don't care. But don't take
any further action.

535
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,766
What about Hathaway's clinic?

536
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,766
Close it.

537
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,033
Alright, public relations will
handle all the press inquiries

538
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,700
and Dr. Romano and I
will talk to the staff

539
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,600
and make sure they cooperate
with the police fully.

540
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,633
That's it.

541
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,566
Kerry, Mark.

542
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,366
I don't know what to say.

543
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:15,700
When the dust settles,
I will personally

544
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,533
chair an investigation
into this matter

545
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:20,000
and the appropriate disciplinary
action will be taken.

546
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:24,066
And on a more personal note..

547
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,533
I don't think I've ever
been more disappointed

548
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,500
in two people in my life.

549
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,233
Kerry, sorry this..

550
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,130
I think I just beat it in, the
roads are getting really slick.

551
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:12,796
Took me forever
to navigate the Kennedy.

552
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,163
Traffic was backed
up...for miles.

553
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,630
What's the matter,
somebody die?

554
00:25:16,663 --> 00:25:17,830
Somebody we know?

555
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:19,563
Dr. Ross lost
that ALD Kid.

556
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,363
The police are in trauma two.

557
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,630
The boy's father accused Doug
of giving him an overdose.

558
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:24,830
‐ Called the cops.
‐ Oh, my God.

559
00:25:24,863 --> 00:25:26,363
Yeah. Coroners took the body.

560
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:27,796
Police are interviewing
everybody.

561
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,496
‐ Where's Doug?
‐ In the pedes room, I think.

562
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,763
Chuny, have you seen
the, uh, labs on that

563
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,196
drunk with the head lac?

564
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,496
No, but he managed
to throw up on me again.

565
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,830
Third scrub's up today.

566
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:38,396
Yeah, we should wire
a bucket to his head

567
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,096
like one of those
feedbags for horses.

568
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,630
Yeah, right. Hey, any,
uh, word on Doug Ross?

569
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:44,496
Uh, police are still
interviewing Dr. Greene.

570
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,830
Have you seen Lucy?

571
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:47,563
Dr. Edson keeps coming
down here looking for her.

572
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,563
Yeah, last time I saw her
she was working on the..

573
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:51,163
Hey, where's my, uh, kick boxer?

574
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,730
Dr. Weaver moved
her into exam two

575
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:54,463
when that rule‐out
MI came in.

576
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:56,330
Lucy was still working
on her about ten minutes ago.

577
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:57,596
‐ Suturing?
‐ Yep.

578
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,096
Well, that should've
taken like, two minutes.

579
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,563
‐ I haven't seen her come out.
‐ 'One.'

580
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:03,063
‐ Two, three, four..
‐ My heart's really pumping.

581
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,763
Five, six, seven, eight, and..

582
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:16,096
‐ 'Oh, man.'
‐ 'Dr. Carter.'

583
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,263
Are you okay?
Don't move, don't move.

584
00:26:18,296 --> 00:26:21,630
Chuny, uh, backboard
and a hard collar.

585
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,830
Well, I don't see
any other blood.

586
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:24,396
Nice kick.

587
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,630
‐ 'Damn.'
‐ What happened, ma'am?

588
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:27,296
‐ I kicked him in the chest.
‐ Why?

589
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,163
I was practicing
my tae‐bo.

590
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:30,563
Now we're going
to roll him..

591
00:26:30,596 --> 00:26:33,730
..back under there...one..

592
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:35,830
'Okay, great.
Roll back.'

593
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:39,530
'On my count,
one, two, three.'

594
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,196
‐ So it's good, huh?
‐ Oh, it's terrific.

595
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,396
I'm definitely going.

596
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,563
Maybe I'll come with you.

597
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:58,363
Hey, Doug, I just heard.

598
00:26:58,396 --> 00:27:00,663
‐ You okay?
‐ Yeah.

599
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:03,830
Didn't anyone explain Ricky's
medical condition to them?

600
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,496
And they're still
pursuing it?

601
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,530
Apparently so.

602
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:09,663
I don't believe this.

603
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,830
Well, can I do
anything for you?

604
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,663
Do you need anything?

605
00:27:15,696 --> 00:27:18,730
You know, you're the first
person to ask me that all day.

606
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:21,063
No, I'm fine, thanks.

607
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:22,296
I'm supposed to
work fast track

608
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,163
but I can get
someone to cover.

609
00:27:24,196 --> 00:27:25,563
Could stay here,
help you out.

610
00:27:25,596 --> 00:27:27,163
Well, not much to do.

611
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:29,696
Weaver pulled me away
from seeing patients.

612
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,330
Told me to sit here
and catch up on paperwork.

613
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:33,796
For how long?

614
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,563
Uh, from the tone of her voice,
I'd guess maybe forever.

615
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:40,130
What did Mark say?

616
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:42,496
They're closing ranks,
covering their asses.

617
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,796
Dr. Ross, you have
a couple of minutes?

618
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,296
Sure.

619
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,230
I'm going to grab some coffee.
You set?

620
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:48,430
Yeah, I'm fine.

621
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:49,830
I'm down the hall in 117.

622
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:52,530
‐ Meet you there in five?
‐ Okay.

623
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:07,130
Dr. Greene?

624
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,463
I'm sorry.

625
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:09,663
Is this not
a good time?

626
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:12,063
No, it's fine.
Come on in.

627
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:14,463
Do you remember
my wife, Kubby?

628
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:16,496
Sure. Hi.

629
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,830
Did you two have
an opportunity

630
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,230
to talk about this?

631
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:20,630
His back, it is worse?

632
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:22,596
His back is
better now.

633
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,663
I suggested that
he see a urologist

634
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:27,130
for his other problem.

635
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,663
It's possible that, uh,
he may need surgery.

636
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:31,630
Surgery?

637
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:34,130
If this is uncomfortable

638
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:35,330
for you to have
this discussion

639
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:36,530
about these issues
in front of me

640
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:37,730
I can leave for
a few minutes.

641
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:41,363
No, please.
Uh, stay.

642
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,363
‐ How you doing?
‐ Hey. Hi.

643
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,796
'Have a seat, doctor.'

644
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,296
'Are you sure you don't
want some coffee?'

645
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,263
‐ I got an extra one.
‐ No, I'm fine.

646
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:14,530
Well, I guess I'll
have to drink it myself.

647
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,196
Can't get enough
of this stuff.

648
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,696
‐ Who's that?
‐ That's Detective Brannigan.

649
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,630
He's part of the uh,
felony review team.

650
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:23,296
We investigate all
uh, first‐degree murder cases.

651
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,830
I'm not trying
to hang you out to dry

652
00:29:28,863 --> 00:29:31,230
or ruin your career.

653
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:33,063
But, um..

654
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:35,196
If you showed Mrs. Abbott
how to alter the PCA

655
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,096
to deliver a, uh...
a fatal dose of Dilaudid

656
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,296
you can be held accountable
for Ricky Abbott's death.

657
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:46,296
Now, Miss Hathaway said
that Ricky was getting, uh

658
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,696
80 mics of Dilaudid an hour
through the PCA.

659
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,396
Mics is, uh, micrograms?

660
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,730
And that Ricky's mother,
could give him a, uh

661
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,830
a booster of an additional

662
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:58,796
120 every two hours.

663
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,363
That's right.

664
00:30:00,396 --> 00:30:02,263
But she was
uncertain as to, uh

665
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,663
how much Dilaudid you originally
placed in the machine.

666
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:07,663
It was empty when,
uh, Detective Brannigan

667
00:30:07,696 --> 00:30:10,196
examined it a few minutes ago.

668
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,063
Mr. Sullivan.

669
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,330
I've dedicated my life

670
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:23,796
to pediatric medicine.

671
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,596
I've cared for dozens
of dying kids.

672
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,430
Kids in agony, pain..

673
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:34,196
...you and I
can't even imagine.

674
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:41,496
Ricky Abbott was going to die.

675
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,496
Not in a month.

676
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,563
Or a week, or a day.

677
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:48,430
In hours,
and nothing I did

678
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,530
or‐or could have done

679
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:53,196
was going to change that.

680
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,163
His mother had already watched
one son die from the disease

681
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,596
and she was sitting there

682
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,263
watching her second son

683
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,063
dying a horrible
death from something

684
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,763
that she passed on to him.

685
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:18,296
Sometimes it's impossible

686
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,763
to save a kid's life

687
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:23,296
and the only thing
we can do..

688
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,030
...is save them
from suffering.

689
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:28,230
Leave them with
a little dignity.

690
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:32,730
In the end,
that's all they have.

691
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,496
Tell me, were...
you relieving the, uh..

692
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,730
...the child's suffering

693
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:45,630
or...were you
relieving your own?

694
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,430
'If you were so certain
you were doing the right thing'

695
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:53,096
'why didn't you administer
the, uh, lethal dose yourself?'

696
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:55,430
'You're the doctor.'

697
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:58,630
You could have stayed,
you could have made sure

698
00:31:58,663 --> 00:32:01,063
there were no complications.

699
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:03,830
'That he really did
die with dignity.'

700
00:32:03,863 --> 00:32:05,063
'But you left.'

701
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,163
You knew that
killing that child was wrong.

702
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,730
That's why you...
you snuck out of the house

703
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,230
before dawn, isn't it?

704
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,196
'You didn't want
to be there, did you?'

705
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,663
'You didn't want
to be there..'

706
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:21,263
...because you knew..

707
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:23,363
...killing Ricky Abbott
was wrong.

708
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,530
I don't see a broken rib.

709
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,763
Maybe a hairline fracture.

710
00:32:33,796 --> 00:32:36,296
Uh, I feel like an elephant
sat on my chest.

711
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,530
Well, just stay seated, okay?

712
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:40,730
‐ Don't get up.
‐ Oh.

713
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,763
How did you get that cut
on your forehead?

714
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,363
I think I hit it
with the chart.

715
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,496
You've taken
martial arts before.

716
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,196
Karate when I was
like, seven.

717
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,396
‐ Ouch.
‐ Oh, come on.

718
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,063
It can't hurt that bad.
It's tiny.

719
00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:57,263
‐ It doesn't even need a stitch.
‐ Ouch!

720
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:58,796
Baby.

721
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,130
There.

722
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:05,563
Better?

723
00:33:05,596 --> 00:33:08,163
Much.

724
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:18,596
I'm a doctor,
you're a student.

725
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,096
Mm‐hmm.

726
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,430
So we shouldn't
be doing this.

727
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,263
Mm‐hmm.

728
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,796
Storm's finally here.

729
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,263
Romano closed my clinic.

730
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:49,663
Why?

731
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,596
Because I helped you
get the PCA.

732
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,296
Well, Ricky was dying.

733
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,296
I was there.
I know he was dying.

734
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,530
I didn't know you were
gonna help his mother.

735
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:04,463
Use a piece of
my equipment to administer

736
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:07,730
a lethal dose of Dilaudid.

737
00:34:07,763 --> 00:34:09,130
I didn't want to
get you involved.

738
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:12,463
Oh...but Doug,
I was involved.

739
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:13,830
'I mean..'

740
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:16,630
Were you planning
on telling me...

741
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:19,263
..any of this, ever?

742
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:24,596
I don't know, you know.

743
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,830
Hadn't decided.

744
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:29,263
What about you promising Mark

745
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:30,796
'never to prescribe narcotics?'

746
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,363
I mean, had you
decided on sharing

747
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:36,063
that information with me?

748
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,496
I did what I thought was right.

749
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,563
Damn the consequences or whoever
else gets hurt, right?

750
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:42,130
I was willing to live
with the consequences.

751
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,463
Mark and Kerry are facing
disciplinary action.

752
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:50,163
'My clinic has been closed.'

753
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:52,430
'Which means
hundreds of patients'

754
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:54,396
'have no place else to go.'

755
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,530
The police..

756
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:59,363
...are questioning
the entire ER Staff.

757
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,230
'Your actions carry
consequences, Doug.'

758
00:35:04,263 --> 00:35:07,163
It's not just about you.

759
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,396
Do you even give a damn?

760
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:19,430
Hey, hey don't do that.
Don't walk away.

761
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,763
Why not?

762
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:24,296
You don't need anybody else.

763
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,830
You are a country unto yourself.

764
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,330
'You know, you just
make decisions.'

765
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:29,563
'Ruin people's lives.'

766
00:35:29,596 --> 00:35:32,330
Narcissism elevated
to a high art.

767
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,630
‐ 'Carol, Carol.'
‐ What?

768
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,130
I'm sorry.

769
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:45,630
That's what
you always say, Doug.

770
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,596
'Some of the roadways are nearly
impassable as you can see from'

771
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,330
'this video we've taken end
of the last half hour.'

772
00:36:22,363 --> 00:36:25,396
'Both the airports, Midway
and O'Hare, are closed..'

773
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,663
I'll never get home now.

774
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:28,296
‐ Somebody beep me?
‐ I did.

775
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,530
Where you been?
I'm getting buried down here.

776
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:30,730
Upstairs with legal.

777
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:32,363
We are stacked up.

778
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:34,196
When Romano closed
Carol's clinic

779
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,530
all her cases got
dumped onto our service.

780
00:36:36,563 --> 00:36:38,263
And most of them are still
waiting out in chairs.

781
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,563
Jerry, stop watching TV

782
00:36:39,596 --> 00:36:41,330
and get your tail over here.

783
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:43,130
How long will the police
gonna keep trauma two tied up?

784
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,563
‐ I don't know.
‐ I'll find out.

785
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,230
Why does Carter have so many
old cases up on the board?

786
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:48,463
Oh, he got kicked
in the chest.

787
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:50,296
Lucy's working on him
down in six.

788
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,196
Could this day
get any worse?

789
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,796
Connie, go tell the clinic
patients we're sorry

790
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,730
but we're not going
to them today

791
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:58,263
so they might
as well go home.

792
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,796
Chuny, go see
how Carter's doing.

793
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,263
If he can't work today,
we'll have to call

794
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:04,130
in the jeopardy resident
to help out.

795
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,823
‐ You got it.
‐ Damn it, Jerry.

796
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,056
Stop watching that TV
or I'm gonna run over there

797
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,923
and rip it off the wall
with my bare hands

798
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:12,156
'and beat you
to death with it!'

799
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:19,423
‐ 'Wait, wait.'
‐ 'But I almost got it .'

800
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:20,823
'No, I mean really wait.'

801
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,956
'Um...yeah.'

802
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,323
This isn't right.

803
00:37:25,356 --> 00:37:27,856
‐ We can't be doing this.
‐ Why not?

804
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,856
Well, because
there are rules.

805
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,456
What, you mean, you think
we could get in trouble?

806
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,056
Not "we."
Me.

807
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,190
'Dr. Carter, you in there?'

808
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:38,423
You, uh...you locked
that door, right?

809
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,256
Yeah. Absolutely.

810
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,123
Both of them?

811
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,356
Dr. Carter, you okay?

812
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,890
‐ 'Just a second.'
‐ What are you doing?

813
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:51,923
You locked the door in her face.
She knows somebody's in here.

814
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,123
How you feeling?

815
00:37:57,156 --> 00:37:59,823
Much better,
thank you.

816
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,023
Lucy?

817
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:02,356
Oh, he didn't
need any stitches.

818
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,956
‐ That's good.
‐ I'm going back to work.

819
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,890
You're inside out.

820
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:09,190
Your sweater, you've got
it on inside out.

821
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:16,790
When did it
stop snowing?

822
00:38:18,123 --> 00:38:20,423
A few minutes ago.

823
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,290
We don't look much
like dangerous felons.

824
00:38:27,323 --> 00:38:30,256
Speak for yourself.

825
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,156
I'm so sorry
about all this.

826
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,323
You okay?

827
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:38,156
Are you?

828
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:41,890
I've had better days.

829
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:45,590
Yeah.

830
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,056
You know, when..

831
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,456
...when Michael died

832
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,123
I cried for days.

833
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,356
I felt that...
that I'd died, too.

834
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,990
'That I'd..'

835
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:04,523
...never...feel love

836
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:06,490
or joy again.

837
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:09,390
And then..

838
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,456
...Ricky came and read to me.

839
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,123
'He'd sit on the end
of the bed and'

840
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:21,323
tell me these stupid jokes

841
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:22,890
'that he'd heard
in second grade'

842
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:24,956
'and...he'd smile.'

843
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:30,123
God...I..

844
00:39:30,156 --> 00:39:32,090
I wish you'd seen him like that.

845
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:46,323
Joi.

846
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,823
You still have your daughter.

847
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,423
Yeah.

848
00:39:55,456 --> 00:39:58,123
I guess I should go back inside.

849
00:39:58,156 --> 00:40:00,823
See if my ex‐husband's ready
to let me talk to her again.

850
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:10,490
Thank you, Dr. Ross.

851
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,456
For everything.

852
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,823
Yeah.

853
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:29,590
The 92 year old dislocated ankle
in exam one has been reduced.

854
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:32,890
Lydia, give her a Vicodin and
tell her to stay off her skates.

855
00:40:32,923 --> 00:40:35,423
92 years old
and she's still skates.

856
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:36,856
You got something
on your neck.

857
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,423
‐ Where?
‐ Right there.

858
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:39,923
‐ Looks like somebody bit you.
‐ Yeah.

859
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:41,123
I think I might
have hit something

860
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:43,090
when I fell down.

861
00:40:44,856 --> 00:40:46,056
You bit me.

862
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,356
What? No, I didn't.

863
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,423
Oh! Guess I must
have gotten carried away.

864
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:53,323
Hm‐mmm!

865
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:55,390
Now, that's what
I'm talking about. Mmm!

866
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:58,290
Roxanne called, twice.

867
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,823
‐ So?
‐ So?

868
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:01,023
So what, Jerry?

869
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,556
So, Lucy.

870
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,290
Yeah. Come on, man.
Everybody knows.

871
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:06,290
I heard it from the cashier
in the cafeteria.

872
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:07,490
Sheri from radiology‐‐

873
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:08,890
I'm not having
this conversation.

874
00:41:08,923 --> 00:41:10,356
Can somebody answer
the MICN, please?

875
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,090
Nothing happened.

876
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:13,290
Mark, I got
to talk to you.

877
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:14,523
I got patients.

878
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,023
Listen.

879
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,423
I'm going to go to Anspaugh,
I'm gonna tell him

880
00:41:17,456 --> 00:41:19,390
that I coerced you
and Kerry to go along

881
00:41:19,423 --> 00:41:20,590
with me on this
drug protocol thing.

882
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:22,090
Coerced? How?

883
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:24,190
Tell him that I‐I begged you
not to report it.

884
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:26,123
That I promised that
I would do it myself.

885
00:41:26,156 --> 00:41:28,190
And that's the only reason
that you didn't report it.

886
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:30,223
I think there's been
enough lying, Doug.

887
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:32,190
Why don't we all just stick
to the truth for once?

888
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,390
I'm, I'm trying to help.

889
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:34,923
I don't want your help.

890
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:36,923
I made decisions
of my own free will

891
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:38,990
and I'm ready to
stand behind them.

892
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:40,256
So, you don't believe me.

893
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,590
I don't know
what to believe.

894
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,190
You lie to me.

895
00:41:43,223 --> 00:41:45,356
Undermine my authority
every chance you get.

896
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,523
Bend the rules
to fit your needs.

897
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:49,923
I'll bet, that's how we do it.
I'll just lie my way out of it

898
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:51,123
I'm just trying
to do you a favor.

899
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:52,490
'Hey, Mark.'

900
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:54,256
Don't do me anymore
favors, alright, Doug?

901
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,290
I'll be lucky if I survive the
ones you've already done for me.

902
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:57,956
‐ Mark.
‐ What?

903
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,590
We got a school bus
flipped over by a snowplow.

904
00:41:59,623 --> 00:42:01,356
Kids are trapped, firemen
need a doctor on the scene.

905
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,090
‐ Where?
‐ Downtown somewhere.

906
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:04,990
Couple of the kids may even die
before we can get them out.

907
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,256
I wanted to go, but Weaver
thought it should be you.

908
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,156
Unit 62 is waiting
for you in the bay.

909
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,423
‐ How many?
‐ Fifteen.

910
00:42:10,456 --> 00:42:11,890
Nine are still trapped,
this snowplow blade

911
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:13,456
intruded right into the bus.

912
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,190
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

913
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:16,956
‐ You need a pediatrician.
‐ You are off the service.

914
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,256
I'm coming.

915
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,356
The hell you are.

916
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:23,731
Ready to go, doc?

917
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:25,664
Yeah. Let's do it.

918
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:27,097
‐ Get back inside.
‐ Coming with you.

919
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:28,597
‐ You got kids dying out there.
‐ Oh, well.

920
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,764
Maybe you'll think
about that next time.

921
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:40,131
Hey, Doug,
where you going?

922
00:42:40,164 --> 00:42:41,631
Driving myself.

923
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:43,831
‐ I'm going with you.
‐ You don't have a coat.

924
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,297
I'll get one.
Just wait... wait for me!

925
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:03,731
We got five out.

926
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:05,231
We got the jaws working
the forward section

927
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:07,897
but we got three kids trapped
inside under the plow blade.

928
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:09,164
Lot of blood,
I was afraid they'd

929
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:10,997
bleed out before
we could get them out.

930
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:13,097
I got a crane coming
to try lift that snowplow off.

931
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,931
The driver tried to stop,
but it's pure ice.

932
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:16,597
Plow hit him dead on.

933
00:43:16,631 --> 00:43:18,131
We're going in through
the side window.

934
00:43:18,164 --> 00:43:20,331
Climb down to reach them.

935
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,797
Doc, it's pretty bad in there.

936
00:43:23,597 --> 00:43:25,297
Watch your step.

937
00:43:25,331 --> 00:43:26,897
‐ Skipper?
‐ 'Yeah?'

938
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:29,664
We're going to need O‐neg,
lots of it, okay?

939
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:31,164
‐ And get some propane heaters.
‐ 'You got it.'

940
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:32,597
Let's blow up
some heat in here

941
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,564
before these kids
freeze to death.

942
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:37,697
Hey, turn this up.
I love this song.

943
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:39,197
"Earth, Wind And Fire?"

944
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:41,964
My dad used
to love them.
