1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,300
Previously on "ER".

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,666
Be good, son.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,133
We typically only do amnio
when you're over 35

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,166
unless you have genetic
disorders in your family.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,300
No.

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,333
No, Reggie.
I'm seeing someone else.

7
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,366
Dr. Carter, can I hang around
and see how this goes?

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,666
Absolutely.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,700
Thank you, but I'm taking

10
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:25,533
the Trauma Fellowship, okay?

11
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:26,800
Fine. Whatever, Peter.

12
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,400
I'd consider you
for cardiothoracic.

13
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:29,700
I thought that
belonged to Peter.

14
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,600
Ritalin is for
hyperactive children. You're 24.

15
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,133
And my doctor still
prescribes it.

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,333
So I'm not doing
anything wrong.

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,033
Did I do something wrong,
officer?

18
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm just trying
to get your attention.

19
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,800
Which has not been
that easy to do of late.

20
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,200
I've been busy working.

21
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,233
And seeing someone else.

22
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:17,633
I have to get to work.

23
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,066
‐ I'll give you a lift.
‐ It's two blocks away.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,266
You don't want to be resisting
an officer here, do you?

25
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,033
Oh, what are you gonna do,
arrest me?

26
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:26,466
I'm a cop. It's what I do.

27
00:01:29,266 --> 00:01:30,466
Okay, you win.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,566
Oh, whoa. Oh.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Uh‐oh.

30
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:37,033
Let's pick up the doggy.

31
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,733
Can you say doggy, Reese?

32
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,133
'Doggy. Arf'

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,166
'Doggy.'

34
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,700
I don't think
he's got that one yet.

35
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,400
He will soon.
He's doing great.

36
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,500
He's responding
to vocalizations

37
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:52,300
repeating back more.

38
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,600
I just wish we had more time.

39
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,200
In about a month,
I'll be able to add

40
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,800
a couple more sessions a week.

41
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,566
Cutting back
on your schedule?

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,733
Well, this Trauma Fellowship
that I'm going to be doing

43
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,433
will give me more free time.

44
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,033
That's great.

45
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:05,800
On top of the three sessions
we're doing now

46
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,666
Reese is going to make
real progress.

47
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,600
Three? Is Carla coming
twice a week now?

48
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,500
No, just once.

49
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:16,766
But her fiance's doing a session
once a week now, too.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,266
Roger's working with Reese here?

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,266
I assumed you knew.

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,466
No, no, no, I mean..

53
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,533
...it's not a problem, you know.

54
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:28,566
The more we work
with him the better, right?

55
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,266
'Right.'

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,700
'See you next time.'

57
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,100
‐ Excuse me. Is that your son?
‐ What?

58
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,733
No, he's not mine.
Where'd he come from?

59
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,133
‐ Are you with this child?
‐ No.

60
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,500
Hey.

61
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:20,233
Hi, there.
Where's your mommy, huh?

62
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,233
Where's your mommy?

63
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,333
Where's your mommy, huh?

64
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,666
Is he okay?

65
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,300
No.

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,133
Something's not right with him.

67
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,200
Do you feel okay?

68
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,633
What's your name, honey?

69
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,433
Honey, can you
tell me your name?

70
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,200
Huh?

71
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:46,366
Okay. Alright, alright.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,433
Yeah, we're going
to take good care of you.

73
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,533
Don't worry.
You're going to be okay.

74
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,700
Jerry, why can't I get
an outside line?

75
00:04:45,733 --> 00:04:47,700
Because you have to
punch in the code first.

76
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,100
‐ Code?
‐ Yes.

77
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,233
A Rocket Romano
innovation.

78
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,266
What for?

79
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,700
Uh, make things
more difficult

80
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,100
is the only reason
I can imagine.

81
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,500
Jerry, have you seen
Dr. Greene?

82
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,633
Yeah, he's on rounds
with his high holiness.

83
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:58,666
Have you heard
about this new code?

84
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,233
Unbelievable.

85
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,400
Listen, if you see Mark, I need
to speak with him.

86
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,466
Sure.

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,666
Hey, hey, Carla.
Um, it's me.

88
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,100
Listen, I...we need to talk.

89
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,466
No, no, no, no, no.
Reese is fine.

90
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,766
Yeah, but, uh, we need to talk
about some other stuff, okay?

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,366
Yeah, I know, I‐I just, uh..

92
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,700
...well, can you get away
for lunch?

93
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,166
Great. Cool.
I'll meet you there. Bye.

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,666
You just found him?

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,766
He was wandering around
about a block from here.

96
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Resps 11.

97
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,400
'Pupils still pinpoint
and nonreactive.'

98
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:28,666
Lacerations on the feet.
Look infected.

99
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,433
Okay, Haleh, let's get
an O2 mask on him.

100
00:05:30,466 --> 00:05:33,800
CBC, lytes, tox screen,
EKG and bag a urine.

101
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,500
‐ So you think he was just lost?
‐ Lost or neglected.

102
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:40,300
With the decreased resps
and contracted pupils..

103
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,500
...looks like he might have
been given opiates.

104
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,133
Okay, we need to give him
Narcan .1 milligram.

105
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,733
'Stand by
with an intubation tray.'

106
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,600
He's dehydrated.
I can't get a line.

107
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:53,233
Blew the hand
and the antecubital on the arm.

108
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,800
Can't use the feet,
they're infected.

109
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,800
Page surgery.
We need to get IV access.

110
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,100
'Resps are down to eight.
You want to intubate?'

111
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,200
'No, uh, give me
Narcan in a syringe.'

112
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,733
Hold the mouth open.

113
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,566
I'm gonna inject sublingually
into the vascular bed.

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,166
I paged Dr. Corday.
You're not going to intubate?

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,133
Not if this works.

116
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:16,533
'Come on, little guy.'

117
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:18,766
'Let's hear something.
Come on.'

118
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,366
Second EKG was normal

119
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
so we'll hold for another hour
and then release.

120
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,200
'Thank you, Dr. Carter.
Ms. Knight.'

121
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,733
Would that be you catching
your breath from running

122
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:44,533
to get here because
you're 20 minutes late?

123
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:45,633
Sorry.

124
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,133
Let's proceed..

125
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,300
...with presenting
Mr. David Chameides.

126
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,533
Complains of back pain.

127
00:06:52,566 --> 00:06:55,200
Yep, uh..

128
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:57,266
...this is a 68‐year‐old man.

129
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,600
He complains, um,
he presents with back pain

130
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:03,333
and he said it started
two days ago

131
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:06,233
when he was helping his daughter
move into her new apartment.

132
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,766
He was lifting heavy boxes

133
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,766
and she was living in Dubuque,
but she got a divorce

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,433
so she had to move
back here to Chicago.

135
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,700
Did I mention that
the pain was constant?

136
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,566
‐ Not yet.
‐ 'Well, it is.'

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,300
Um, and upon
physical examination‐‐

138
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,733
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about pertinent negatives?

139
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:24,166
Uh, no fever,
no, um, trauma

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,366
no abdominal pain,
no, um..

141
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,700
No, uh..

142
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:32,066
'No..'

143
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,266
...uh, he's a heavy smoker.

144
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,633
And, um,
the BP is 1...sorry.

145
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:44,500
BP is 170/95, um..

146
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,500
...no, no, no, his, um..

147
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:51,566
...his BP is, um, 175/100.
Pulse 95.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
‐ Neuro exam normal?
‐ Yes.

149
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,800
'And could you appreciate
a pulsatile abdominal mass?'

150
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,100
No.

151
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,200
But the ultrasound revealed

152
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:01,100
an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

153
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:03,400
‐ How'd you know that?
‐ Dr. Carter.

154
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,233
Patient has
all the risk factors.

155
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,033
Ms. Knight,
presenting a case

156
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:08,400
is like telling
good stories.

157
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,033
Succinct, focused
and to the point.

158
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,566
Frankly, you lost me somewhere
around Dubuque.

159
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,333
Dr. Carter, Ms. Knight is a
student of yours, is that right?

160
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:15,366
Yes.

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,766
Work harder.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,266
Thank God I've got
a small bowel obstruction

163
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,300
waiting for me upstairs.

164
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,766
Gentlemen. Ms. Knight.

165
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,533
I think we can all thank God
for that small bowel.

166
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,733
If you're going to be late,
at least be prepared.

167
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,266
Any idea as to the source
of the fever?

168
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
No, probably cellulitis.

169
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,133
‐ Kerry, Reggie's still here.
‐ Good.

170
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,300
We're gonna need a photo.

171
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,500
We've got a camera
by the desk.

172
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,233
Carol, as soon as the IV's in

173
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,733
let's get him some juice
and something to eat, okay?

174
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:49,800
Sure.

175
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,266
‐ Could I have a Kelly?
‐ Yep.

176
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
What sort of parents would
just abandon their child?

177
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,433
Well, we're not sure that's
what really happened.

178
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,066
You know, if there are drugs
in his system

179
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,533
parents could be
drug addicts.

180
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:02,333
Not even know
he's missing.

181
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,700
Okay. That's lovely.

182
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,600
I've exposed the saphenous vein,
18 angio.

183
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,266
Is this baby John Doe?

184
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,166
Yeah. Two year old.
Kerry found him.

185
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,700
Mm‐hmm. Looks good.

186
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,166
Jerry said you needed
to talk to me?

187
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,100
Oh, no, I mean,
it's nothing important.

188
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,033
‐ I'll find you.
‐ Okay.

189
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,666
Oh, uh, well, I remembered
to bring my tuxedo

190
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,500
'but I left the tickets
at home.'

191
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:24,366
So can we stop by
on the way?

192
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,566
‐ Sure. Sounds fine.
‐ Okay. Catch you later.

193
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,733
Mm‐hmm.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,666
Okay, IV's in.

195
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,066
Let's start hydrating him

196
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,366
with a bolus of 100 CCs
normal saline

197
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,500
250 milligrams IV Oxacillin

198
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:39,133
and put him on a Narcan drip.

199
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,333
Tuxedo?

200
00:09:41,366 --> 00:09:45,066
Yes, just some, um, fundraiser
thing we agreed to go to.

201
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,500
Uh‐huh.

202
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:52,766
Dr. Weaver, I've still
not found that camera.

203
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
‐ I know it's here somewhere.
‐ Just find it, Jerry.

204
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,100
Jerry, have you seen
my palmtop computer?

205
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:57,633
What, is everything missing now?
No, I haven't.

206
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,366
That's why you're so
scattered this morning?

207
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,500
You lost
your electronic cheat sheet?

208
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,166
Hey, Jerry, when did
Antoine Bell come in?

209
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,500
Oh, yeah, uh,
he asked for you. I'm sorry.

210
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,566
‐ I put him in trauma one.
‐ Just give me a break, alright.

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,033
I didn't get much sleep.

212
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,633
I was late and I got
my cards all messed up.

213
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,500
I've done 100 presentations
without notes, without computers

214
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,766
and definitely without sleep.

215
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,100
So why don't you get
yourself a cup of coffee

216
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,133
and pull yourself together?

217
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,400
I am together.

218
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,033
‐ I went off the Ritalin.
‐ When?

219
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,300
‐ Two days ago.
‐ That's great.

220
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,500
Look, I got a patient.

221
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,133
Maybe we can talk
more later.

222
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,333
Sure.

223
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:28,166
Antoine..

224
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,433
...expected to see you today.
Just not like this.

225
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,300
Antoine does not associate
with any of those gangs.

226
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,033
He knows that, mom.

227
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,133
This is one of those bad
boys from the neighborhood.

228
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,700
And I hate that you've go
to school with them too.

229
00:10:37,733 --> 00:10:40,333
Can we just let Dr. Carter
do his job?

230
00:10:40,366 --> 00:10:41,666
‐ Dr. Carter?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

231
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,600
I am so happy to meet you.

232
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:45,533
'Antoine has so enjoyed
all you've been teaching him.'

233
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,733
And thank you for setting up
this interview for him to go to.

234
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:51,233
Oh, yeah. That's, um,
that's this afternoon, right?

235
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,733
Summer science lab.

236
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,233
‐ Maybe I won't go now.
‐ Of course you're going.

237
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,166
Looking like this?
What are they gonna think?

238
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,733
Hey, let's worry
about that later, huh?

239
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,466
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

240
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,700
Got mugged. Took my wallet.

241
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,500
Follow my finger
with your eyes.

242
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,766
You want an orbital series?

243
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,133
Uh..

244
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,033
...yeah.

245
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,400
Let's check
for a rim fracture.

246
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,500
‐ Does that hurt?
‐ No

247
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,800
No septal hematoma
and you didn't break your nose.

248
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,600
But you might have
an orbital fracture.

249
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:23,266
‐ What do we do about that?
‐ Just apply ice.

250
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,366
Keep his head elevated
when he sleeps.

251
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,166
We'll wait on the X‐ray
to see if you need antibiotics.

252
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,533
‐ Can he go to the interview?
‐ 'Mom!'

253
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:33,766
Oh, come on, Antoine.
It's not that bad.

254
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,666
You've worked hard for this.

255
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,433
We've worked hard for this.
I think your mom's right.

256
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,400
Hey, you'll be the candidate
they'll remember.

257
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,333
There was a man waiting down
in the ultrasound place.

258
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:49,533
I think he's gonna be
parting with his gall bladder

259
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:50,733
later today.

260
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,366
Really tall guy?
Red hair?

261
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,766
Yeah, that's the one.

262
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,566
You're right. They took him
out to surgery.

263
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,533
‐ How did you know?
‐ Oh, what a sweet little face.

264
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,200
‐ 'He's not going to be crying.'
‐ Oh, no, don't worry.

265
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,500
Uh, I think he'll be
pretty quiet.

266
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:04,800
No, that's what I mean

267
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,200
he's not gonna be
doing any crying.

268
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:10,466
This is Celinda Randlett,
in for a rule‐out appy.

269
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,100
‐ She's medically empathetic.
‐ Sorry?

270
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,266
Mm. I can tell
what's going on with people.

271
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,733
‐ Inside them.
‐ 'Kind of like a psychic.'

272
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,433
'No, I don't predict things.'

273
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,666
'I just feel what's happening
in the present.'

274
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,333
It started when I was a girl,
been with me ever since.

275
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,600
But she can't tell
about herself

276
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:30,166
'maybe appendicitis,
maybe not.'

277
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,700
It's not like I can treat
anybody for anything.

278
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:41,066
‐ By the way, when are you due?
‐ Excuse me?

279
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,666
Uh, you know,
I mean when's your due date?

280
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,533
Oh, right, that. Um, well, we'll
be expecting in early November.

281
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,366
Lydia, you want to
help me with this IV?

282
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,533
'Sure.'

283
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,633
Have you called psych yet?

284
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,233
‐ Yeah.
‐ Uh‐huh.

285
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,800
Hi, there, huh?
How are you doing?

286
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,166
You know, he's doing pretty
good. He's settling in.

287
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,466
Great. You got a stuffed cow.
That's pretty neat.

288
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:06,638
Jerry finally found
the camera.

289
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,972
Carol, can you, uh,
prop his head up a little bit?

290
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,272
‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ There you go.

291
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,938
Come on, little guy,
let's sit you up.

292
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:14,605
‐ He's been through quite a lot.
‐ 'Oh, yeah.'

293
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,938
'Wandering around by himself
about a block from here, lost.'

294
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:20,105
No, he doesn't look lost.

295
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:21,338
He looks found.

296
00:13:21,372 --> 00:13:24,572
Alright, let me
just get one more.

297
00:13:27,672 --> 00:13:28,972
Hey, where's
the roach coach?

298
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:31,338
Ah, let's go over
to Doc Magoo's.

299
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,838
So you wanted to talk
about something?

300
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,205
Yeah, about tonight,
actually.

301
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:36,005
I've never been
to this fundraiser before

302
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,338
but it's a dinner cruise

303
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:39,738
around the lake, swing band,
How bad can it be?

304
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,972
No, sounds wonderful. I'm really
looking forward to it.

305
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:44,838
It's just we've never
actually talked, you know.

306
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:46,238
Oh! Elizabeth!

307
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,872
‐ You alright?
‐ Yeah.

308
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:59,005
You okay in there?
You alright?

309
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,205
It's okay. It's alright.
We're gonna help you.

310
00:14:01,238 --> 00:14:03,005
My dad.
Please help my dad.

311
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:04,838
Okay. It's okay. It's alright.

312
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:07,005
We need a couple of gurneys
out here!

313
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:14,772
He's had four of Ativan.

314
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:15,805
Alright, give him another two.

315
00:14:15,838 --> 00:14:16,905
Good breath sounds.

316
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:20,072
BP's 125/75, pulse 100.

317
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,872
No signs of abdominal trauma.

318
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,238
Let's get the ultrasound on him
and see if there's any bleeding.

319
00:14:24,272 --> 00:14:26,305
The pupils are equal
and reactive.

320
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:29,238
Here we go.
That's more like it.

321
00:14:29,272 --> 00:14:31,205
Okay, Malik, load him
with a gram of Dilantin.

322
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,238
He'll need a C‐spine
and a head CT.

323
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,772
You got it.

324
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,605
No evidence of
intra‐abdominal bleeding.

325
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:36,972
Alright.
Well, that's a good sign.

326
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,972
I'm gonna go
talk to his daughter.

327
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:42,172
Hi.
I'm Dr. Greene.

328
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:44,272
‐ How are you doing?
‐ Okay.

329
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:47,072
Your dad's doing okay, too.

330
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,838
Ms. Knight,
why don't you fill me in?

331
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,872
Uh, this is Sarah..

332
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,738
‐ Uh, sorry. Sarah..
‐ Bengossi.

333
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,738
Bengossi and she is ten.

334
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:58,005
Uh, she has facial lacerations,
bruise to her forehead.

335
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:01,672
Normal cranial nerve exam,
no loss of consciousness.

336
00:15:01,705 --> 00:15:03,605
She was in a car accident
right outside the ER.

337
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:05,038
She was driving.

338
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,305
I know about that part,
don't I?

339
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,272
So did you ask her
what happened?

340
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:12,772
Car accident.

341
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:16,205
And she said she hit
the el or something.

342
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:20,205
Call me crazy...but you're
too young to drive, aren't you?

343
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:21,305
Yeah.

344
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,838
Not that you're not
a good driver.

345
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:24,672
I mean, that el stanchion
just jumped right out

346
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,672
in the middle there,
didn't it?

347
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,772
So did something happen
to your dad?

348
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,338
Well, he has epilepsy.

349
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:33,172
'He hasn't had a seizure
in two years.'

350
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,738
When that happens
I know what to do.

351
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,772
He and mom taught us.

352
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:39,638
This time he was driving,
so you had to grab the wheel.

353
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,172
Well, it was kind of hard
to reach the pedals.

354
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:45,238
But you thought fast enough
to get him to the ER.

355
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:47,605
Yeah, well, we brought
my brother here last week.

356
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:49,838
He fell out of his bunk bed
and broke his collar bone.

357
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:51,938
Well, you did
a great job, Sarah.

358
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:54,372
And you know,
when I tell my 10 year old

359
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:58,738
that you got to drive,
she is gonna be so jealous.

360
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:01,605
Yosh, why don't you
get that cut cleaned up

361
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:02,905
and get her in
to see her dad.

362
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:05,305
‐ 'Sure, no problem.'
‐ 'Lucy, come with me.'

363
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,138
I was going to ask her
what happened.

364
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,605
I just didn't get a chance to,
and then you walked in‐‐

365
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,238
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up!
Hold up, hold up!

366
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,038
Okay, hold up! Okay?
What's going on?

367
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,372
‐ Are you okay?
‐ I'm fine. I'm definitely fine.

368
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:18,272
You didn't seem definitely fine
this morning

369
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,238
when you were presenting
that patient to Dr. Romano.

370
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:22,772
I've seen you handle kids much
better than you did just now.

371
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,805
Dr. Greene, I didn't get
much sleep last night, alright?

372
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:28,038
You're gonna get even less
when you're a resident.

373
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,072
You gotta learn
to deal with it.

374
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,672
Jeanie. I was
looking for you.

375
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,005
Hey, did they
find anything?

376
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,005
No kids reported missing
in the past week.

377
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,105
‐ What about the neighborhood?
‐ Nothing's turned up yet.

378
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:43,772
But I'll let you know
if I hear anything else.

379
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,838
‐ Alright, I'll fill Kerry in.
‐ Okay.

380
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,238
‐ You gotta get back to work?
‐ Yeah.

381
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,005
They called in all
the PO's in this district.

382
00:16:49,038 --> 00:16:50,938
Some lunatic is standing
on top of a van

383
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:52,805
down on Madison
waving a .45.

384
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:54,038
Shooting at people?

385
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:57,105
No, threatening
to kill himself.

386
00:16:57,138 --> 00:16:59,105
‐ Catch you later.
‐ Okay.

387
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,272
Hey, uh, thanks
for the ride this morning.

388
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:02,572
My pleasure.

389
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:05,905
'So we have to use
this code first?'

390
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:07,772
‐ All calls get charged to it?
‐ Right.

391
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:09,272
So if I use the code
for my phone at home‐‐

392
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:12,272
‐ Yeah, good luck.
‐ I could use some help here.

393
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:15,005
Hello, ER.
Nope, she's not here.

394
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,872
Okay. McLucas has to cancel.

395
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,772
Call to reschedule.
Okay, I'll tell her.

396
00:17:21,805 --> 00:17:23,705
‐ Anyone seen Carol?
‐ She's in curtain three.

397
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,238
Her doctor's appointment
was canceled.

398
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,605
‐ She needs to call McLucas.
‐ Oh, yeah, I know her.

399
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,905
She was, uh, Connie's OB
when she had her baby.

400
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,272
‐ Did you say baby?
‐ You don't think sh‐‐

401
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:35,038
Pop‐Tart in the toaster?

402
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:36,705
That empathetic woman
did ask about her due date.

403
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:38,172
That what woman?

404
00:17:38,205 --> 00:17:40,372
Yosh, did you hear anything
about Carol being pregnant?

405
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:41,772
By Doug Ross?

406
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,072
Yeah, I'm sure
it would be Doug.

407
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,805
You know, McLucas
is also a GYN.

408
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:46,238
Maybe Carol's just
going in for a checkup

409
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,205
or a yeast infection?

410
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:50,338
‐ What is it, Jerry?
‐ They think Carol's knocked up.

411
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:53,038
‐ Wow. She happy about it?
‐ She hasn't told anyone.

412
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,005
She must have told someone.

413
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:01,772
What?

414
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:04,772
‐ How's he doing?
‐ He's doing great.

415
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,272
But I still can't get him
to tell me his name.

416
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:07,972
Definitely not a talker.

417
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,205
The police haven't
come up with anything yet.

418
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:12,738
How can you not know
where your child is

419
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,205
unless you abandoned him?

420
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:16,605
Labs came back.
He tested positive for opiates.

421
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,205
Great.
Drugs lying around the house.

422
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,238
'I mean, if he was crying a lot'

423
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:24,672
maybe they gave him something
to quiet him down.

424
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,172
I don't know.

425
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,772
I'll look in
on him later, okay?

426
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,238
Okay.

427
00:18:29,272 --> 00:18:30,772
Hey.

428
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,605
He's alright now.

429
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,172
Although there's still
something inside of him.

430
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:36,905
I...just don't know
what it is.

431
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,072
Well, he has an infection.
Cellulitis.

432
00:18:40,772 --> 00:18:42,705
No, that's not it.

433
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,238
So anyway, have you started
thinking about names?

434
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:51,305
'That's the hard part, you know.
Everybody's got an opinion.'

435
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:56,338
You are in the family way,
aren't you

436
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:58,038
'as my grandmother
used to say.'

437
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:01,205
How could you tell?

438
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:04,205
Like I said, I'm sensitive
to what's going on with people.

439
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:13,038
Like that gentleman over there,
I'm sad to say...has leukemia.

440
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,838
You could have looked
at his chart.

441
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:20,605
That's right.
I could have.

442
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,038
The odd thing is,
I can't tell

443
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,905
if you're having
a boy or a girl.

444
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:30,238
Oh, well, I'm just beginning
my second trimester, so..

445
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:32,872
No. I can usually tell
long before that.

446
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:38,605
So you've had this gift
your whole life?

447
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:41,038
Well, it doesn't seem
like much of a gift

448
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:43,172
when I see a gentleman
like that.

449
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,038
What?

450
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:55,805
Nothing.

451
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:01,738
Hey, Carla, uh, look,
I'm sorry I'm late.

452
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,138
It's okay.

453
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:06,272
I'm glad you called.
I needed to talk to you.

454
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,738
Yeah. I, uh..

455
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,938
Look, um,
I know I haven't..

456
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:12,072
...I haven't spoken to you
about Roger working

457
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:15,705
with Reese on language
and Martha called

458
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:17,172
and told me about
this morning.

459
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:19,338
Yeah, look.

460
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:22,338
I was angry at first,
but, uh, Carla, I know

461
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,138
you know, the more anybody
works with him

462
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,338
the quicker he's gonna learn,
so it's okay.

463
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:30,905
Peter..

464
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,338
...Roger and I got
married last weekend.

465
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:37,805
Wow.

466
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,772
There's a lot you haven't
told me yet.

467
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:45,172
His company is transferring
him to Germany, Hamburg.

468
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:50,038
I'm gonna sell the restaurant
and we're going..

469
00:20:50,072 --> 00:20:52,172
...and I'm taking
Reese with us.

470
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,138
Carla, what are you..

471
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,872
We're, we're not gonna
even have this conversation.

472
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,738
‐ Peter.
‐ You know what?

473
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:02,005
There's no way in hell
am I gonna let that happen.

474
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:03,238
Look, he's gonna
have to be

475
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,905
with one of us
and I'm his mother.

476
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,205
'This will happen.'

477
00:21:08,705 --> 00:21:10,038
Oh, Mark,
do you have a minute?

478
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,205
Uh, yeah. You want to talk
about something?

479
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:12,672
Yeah. I've moved
Mr. Bengossi

480
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,338
and his daughter, Sarah,
to the Exam Four.

481
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:15,838
That's what you
wanted to talk about?

482
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:16,905
Uh..

483
00:21:18,972 --> 00:21:21,105
No time
like the present.

484
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:22,672
Alright.

485
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,072
I want to talk about, uh..

486
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:26,038
...you know,
what's been going on between us

487
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,638
over the past few weeks.

488
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:31,038
Something been going on?
Come on, we'll talk in here.

489
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,205
Look, Mark, it's no big deal
or anything.

490
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:34,972
It's‐it's just that..
Carol.

491
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:37,605
Ah, damn, I thought
I locked that door.

492
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,072
What are you doing?

493
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:41,672
‐ An ultrasound.
‐ On yourself?

494
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,672
Yes, Mark. My, uh, my doctor's
appointment canceled

495
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,738
and no one was using
the equipment.

496
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,805
'Well, why don't you
let us do it? Okay?'

497
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,105
If you must.

498
00:21:51,638 --> 00:21:53,138
Let me get it.

499
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,972
You think it's too early to tell
if it's a girl or a boy?

500
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:58,138
It's never too early
to be inaccurate.

501
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,638
There's the heartbeat.

502
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,638
Any turtle sign?

503
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:07,038
I'm looking.

504
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:09,938
Okay.

505
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,772
There's the, uh..

506
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,238
‐ Mark?
‐ Uh‐huh.

507
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:19,305
What? Mark? What?

508
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,138
Heartbeat.

509
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:25,638
Yes, Mark. Elizabeth
already said that. What?

510
00:22:25,672 --> 00:22:27,705
And what he means is
there's another heartbeat.

511
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:36,038
Twins?

512
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,305
Jerry, what's up
with Malik?

513
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:51,805
He's got a big grin
on his face.

514
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:53,805
He knows nothing.

515
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:56,838
I mean, uh, he's just
a naturally happy person.

516
00:22:56,872 --> 00:22:59,372
‐ Yeah, that's Malik.
‐ Downright inspiring.

517
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:02,272
And infectious.
I'm happy, too.

518
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,305
Excuse me. Could somebody
please tell me

519
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:06,972
what the hell's going on
with these phones?

520
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:09,672
Dr. Romano has instituted
a code system

521
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:12,105
'so that people don't make
so many personal calls.'

522
00:23:12,795 --> 00:23:14,729
‐ 'A code system?'
‐ 'Yes, sir.'

523
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,629
Poor kid ditched school
only to ride his bike

524
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,795
into the side of a bus.

525
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,562
Life is not fair. Lucy.

526
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:22,262
Um, X‐ray definitely shows
a fracture in the ankle.

527
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:23,862
‐ What kind?
‐ Comminuted.

528
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:25,662
Trimalleolar.
Which needs?

529
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,495
Open reduction
and internal fixation.

530
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:29,295
Mark, we got a double trauma
coming in.

531
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:31,495
Two GSWs. Police officer
and the man who shot him.

532
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,862
Wh‐what happened?

533
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,962
Some guy was waving a .45
around. Police got him.

534
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:37,229
Alright, find Carter or Weaver
and let's get set up.

535
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:42,729
Carol, did you..

536
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,529
Did you notice this before?

537
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,729
'Here.'

538
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,695
Looks like a small scar
from surgery.

539
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,795
Hey, it's okay.
We're just looking you over.

540
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,495
Yes. Alright.

541
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:57,462
Let's just look you over.

542
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:00,562
He's got a shunt.

543
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:04,029
From the ventricles
in his brain..

544
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,562
...to his peritoneum.

545
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,329
He was probably born
with hydrocephalus.

546
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:10,695
What's a shunt?

547
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:13,995
It's like a small tube
that runs through the body.

548
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,262
It drains excess fluid.

549
00:24:17,295 --> 00:24:19,562
That must be what I've been
feeling inside him then.

550
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:22,729
Carol, please.

551
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,862
‐ I'm sorry.
‐ No problem. Mystery solved.

552
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,962
He could have
a shunt infection.

553
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:34,562
‐ We need to do a tap.
‐ Go bye‐bye?

554
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:37,695
Yeah, you wanna go bye‐bye,
don't you, huh?

555
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:41,462
‐ Where's the officer?
‐ What?

556
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:42,729
The cop.
He shot a cop.

557
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:44,429
Oh, another unit took him
to Mercy.

558
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:46,662
Approximately 40 years old.
GSW x 2 to the left chest.

559
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:48,362
Full arrest.
Two lines in.

560
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:49,595
Weak pulse in the field
and then he lost it.

561
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:51,395
Agonal rhythm on the scope.

562
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:53,362
This is Jeanie Boulet at County.
I need to check on an officer..

563
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:55,462
'Lucy, over here, I'll show you
how to put in an atrial line.'

564
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,529
‐ Thoracotomy tray.
‐ Hey, sorry to barge in.

565
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:01,295
Lucy, I got a call
from Psych.

566
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:02,962
Were you supposed to see
some kid like 20 minutes ago?

567
00:25:02,995 --> 00:25:05,629
‐ Seth Willows. Yeah.
‐ 'Well, you better go.'

568
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,795
They said Mercy.
Could you check again, please?

569
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:11,029
‐ Asystole on the monitor.
‐ I'll take over bagging.

570
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:13,495
Alright, squeeze in that O‐neg
as fast as you can.

571
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,862
‐ Rib spreader.
‐ Well, I need suction.

572
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:21,762
'Whoa!'

573
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,829
Lap pad.
Left ventricle's shredded.

574
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:30,262
Give me a sponge stick.

575
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,895
Second shot transected
the ascending aorta.

576
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,995
Two units in.
Still asystole.

577
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:36,695
Okay, that's it.

578
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,762
There's nothing
we can do here.

579
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:41,295
I'm calling it.

580
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:44,229
Time of death, 15:09.

581
00:25:49,062 --> 00:25:51,462
‐ Reggie.
‐ He didn't make it?

582
00:25:53,829 --> 00:25:55,362
Not even close.

583
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,695
We heard that
an officer was shot.

584
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:01,962
Bullet grazed his shoulder.
He'll be okay.

585
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,762
Well, could have been
much worse.

586
00:26:06,795 --> 00:26:08,895
Carter, let's go talk
about your student.

587
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:17,595
So it was you
who shot him?

588
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,262
Hey, Seth.

589
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:27,695
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

590
00:26:27,729 --> 00:26:29,662
Um, a trauma came in
to the ER.

591
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:32,629
And I got delayed.

592
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,695
Okay, that's not true.
I forgot.

593
00:26:34,729 --> 00:26:36,662
And I'm really sorry.

594
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:38,995
Seth?

595
00:26:40,995 --> 00:26:42,662
‐ Seth?
‐ What?

596
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:44,895
What? What? What?
What? What? What?

597
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:46,862
Please.

598
00:26:46,895 --> 00:26:49,595
Can we just talk
about this?

599
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:51,562
I don't feel like
talking right now.

600
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:02,929
I know you're angry
and you have every right to be.

601
00:27:11,295 --> 00:27:12,962
You know, I do need to get
on there at some point.

602
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:14,795
In a minute, Jerry.

603
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,495
Jerry, don't we have a
lost‐and‐now‐it's‐ours box

604
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:17,995
around here somewhere?

605
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,562
‐ Yeah, right here.
‐ Oh, thanks.

606
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,395
So the police find out
anything about that little boy?

607
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:24,562
‐ I hear he has a shunt.
‐ Nothing yet.

608
00:27:24,595 --> 00:27:26,595
I'm e‐mailing all his info
and a scanned photo

609
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:28,495
to all the board‐certified
neurosurgeons.

610
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,829
All of them?

611
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:32,695
There's only 380
that specialize in pediatrics.

612
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,029
Hopefully, someone
will recognize him.

613
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:35,629
So we know where he belongs.

614
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:38,262
Three hundred and eighty?
And which one are you on?

615
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:40,029
Elizabeth, are you about ready
to take a break?

616
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:43,929
I wish. I've got a vegetectomy
and a valvuloplasty with Romano.

617
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,729
‐ How are you taking the news?
‐ I'm‐I'm in denial.

618
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,362
But thanks for asking.

619
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:50,295
Mark, what are you doing?

620
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:52,662
Uh, I have a woman
who has arthritis

621
00:27:52,695 --> 00:27:54,695
and so I had to cut
her wedding ring off

622
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:56,729
and so I thought
I'd glue it back together

623
00:27:56,762 --> 00:28:00,262
and hang it on a chain, so she
could wear it around her neck.

624
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,895
‐ That's very sweet of you.
‐ Yeah, I thought she'd like it.

625
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:04,862
‐ I'll catch you later.
‐ Uh‐huh.

626
00:28:12,662 --> 00:28:14,495
Mark, what's that movie called

627
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,629
where, um, where all the people
turn into some kind of a pod?

628
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:18,995
What?

629
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,729
His life was
in his own hands, not yours.

630
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:24,262
There must have been
20 other cops out there.

631
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:26,562
I don't know.
My patrol car was closest.

632
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:31,662
It was just random, I guess.

633
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:34,295
Yeah. I don't think I believe
in random anymore.

634
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:38,729
You know, Reggie,
when I told you

635
00:28:38,762 --> 00:28:41,695
that I was seeing
someone else..

636
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:43,662
...that wasn't
the complete truth.

637
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,995
I'd just found out that
I have hepatitis C.

638
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:57,995
I'm responding to medication.
It's under control.

639
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:00,529
You didn't think I could
handle that kind of news?

640
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:02,495
I couldn't handle
that kind of news.

641
00:29:04,462 --> 00:29:05,829
I just kept thinking,
why me?

642
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:08,829
Why this on top of
everything else?

643
00:29:08,862 --> 00:29:12,529
But after a while, I came
to see that I wasn't sick.

644
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:13,929
I was healed.

645
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:17,895
I don't think
I'm getting this.

646
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,562
I think that God kept
throwing things at me

647
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:20,995
until finally I realized

648
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:23,362
that it's not about
what happens to us

649
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:26,729
it's about how we deal with
what happens to us.

650
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:30,962
We have choices.
Our lives are in our own hands.

651
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:34,029
So you think what happened today
was some kind of message for me.

652
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:37,329
Maybe, what happened today
didn't happen to you.

653
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:39,329
Maybe it happened for you.

654
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:44,762
Yeah, I understand
what you're saying.

655
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:48,629
I'm not sure it makes me feel
all that much better.

656
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,362
Sitting here feels
pretty good.

657
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:55,529
Yeah, it does.

658
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,429
You're awfully quiet, Peter.
Bad mood?

659
00:30:07,462 --> 00:30:08,895
Just working.

660
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:11,362
Ah, the nimble fingers
of a surgeon toiling away.

661
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,995
Suction, please. Let's give him
a nice, clean field.

662
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:14,695
I know you didn't expect
to be assisting today.

663
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,562
‐ But I hope you don't mind.
‐ Of course not.

664
00:30:17,595 --> 00:30:18,795
This might very well be

665
00:30:18,829 --> 00:30:21,529
Dr. Benton's last
cardiothoracic surgery..

666
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:23,762
Cleaned up the vegetation.
6‐0 Prolene.

667
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:25,529
'It's a shame you're not
gonna be able to use'

668
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:29,495
all that hard‐earned knowledge
while you're doing trauma scut.

669
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:32,729
Lizzie, I think
you've actually been spared.

670
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:35,562
Peter was chosen fairly.
I've made my peace with it.

671
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:37,862
An excellent attitude,
which is why I think

672
00:30:37,895 --> 00:30:39,995
we should be trying keep you
on here at County.

673
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,862
'Whether it's with a
Cardiothoracic Fellowship'

674
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:43,629
or something else,
but I know that's something

675
00:30:43,662 --> 00:30:46,495
you're still thinking about
and you should.

676
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:49,929
After all...it's what
any good candidate would do.

677
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:55,262
Dr. Weaver, someone's calling
about that little boy.

678
00:30:55,295 --> 00:30:57,395
Thanks, Jerry. Chuny, can
you stay with him for a moment?

679
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,562
Hey, Carter, you busy? I need
you to look at that patient.

680
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:02,562
‐ Yeah, okay.
‐ Thank you

681
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,029
Antoine? That same kid
jump you again?

682
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:06,595
No.

683
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:07,929
Was it somebody
else from school?

684
00:31:07,962 --> 00:31:11,329
No, it was the same dude.
I jumped him.

685
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:13,329
What?
The kid from this morning?

686
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:15,429
‐ You went after him?
‐ He took my wallet, man.

687
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:18,395
I can't be letting
that go down.

688
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:19,962
Why not? What'd you lose?
Ten‐fifteen bucks?

689
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:27,395
‐ He sounds like my mom.
‐ BP's 128/74. Pulse 96.

690
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,662
You got any pain
in your belly?

691
00:31:28,695 --> 00:31:30,362
Did you get kicked
or punched in the stomach?

692
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:32,329
No, he only got me
in the face.

693
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,629
Looks like a Colles'
with dorsal angulation.

694
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,595
It's gonna need
a closed reduction.

695
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,862
‐ What's that?
‐ You broke your left wrist.

696
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:45,595
Can you feel this?

697
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:46,862
Ah, yeah.

698
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:48,562
What kind of sutures
do you want?

699
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:50,662
5‐0 Vicryl, 6‐0 Nylon.

700
00:31:50,695 --> 00:31:52,395
I gotta have stitches?

701
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:54,729
Fifth metacarpal fracture
with rotational deformity.

702
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,395
You broke both your hands.

703
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:59,562
Let's get an orbital series.
Left hand, right wrist.

704
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:03,462
Call Ortho. That one's gonna
have to be pinned in the OR.

705
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,895
‐ I gotta have an operation?
‐ That's right.

706
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:08,862
Well, you wanted to blow
off your interview.

707
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:15,083
Maybe I can go
in a couple of days.

708
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,650
You're not getting into any
summer science lab. Not now.

709
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:20,783
You have to go to surgery

710
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:23,283
and have a pin
put into your right hand.

711
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,816
Then you get a cast
that goes from your elbow

712
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,450
all the way down
to your fingers.

713
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:28,116
But I can still
go to class.

714
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,616
It's a hands‐on program,
Antoine.

715
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,350
You're not gonna have
use of your hands.

716
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,183
You're not gonna be able
to dress yourself.

717
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,716
You're not gonna be able to
tie your own shoe.

718
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,183
And you're not gonna be able
to blow your own nose

719
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,383
for the next six weeks.

720
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,350
‐ It's not your problem.
‐ No?

721
00:32:39,383 --> 00:32:41,483
I'm the one that's been
spending time with you

722
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:43,183
and showing you around here
for the last month.

723
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,350
Just trying to teach you
something, you know?

724
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:47,183
So you can go and screw it up
by having to go

725
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:48,816
beat down some punk
in the neighborhood.

726
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,483
‐ Carter.
‐ You don't know about it.

727
00:32:50,516 --> 00:32:52,150
I know that it just
dragged you away

728
00:32:52,183 --> 00:32:54,416
from the best opportunity
that you've ever been given.

729
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:57,283
No one gave me anything.
I earned that chance myself.

730
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,583
You just blew it,
all by yourself.

731
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:03,316
‐ Dr. Carter.
‐ Yes, Chuny?

732
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,283
Don't forget
to call Ortho.

733
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,550
Hey, Jerry, any word
on the kid yet?

734
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,816
Uh, just one call
for Dr. Weaver.

735
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,816
Yeah, it was the grocer
I met this morning.

736
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,783
He called to see
what had happened.

737
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:17,150
Labs came back.

738
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,150
Shunt's not causing
the infection.

739
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:21,516
Maybe it's the cellulitis.

740
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,783
Do you think his parents
abandoned him

741
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:24,316
because of the shunt?

742
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,350
What?

743
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,816
I mean, you know, because..

744
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,783
...he wasn't born normal.
Something was wrong with him.

745
00:33:30,816 --> 00:33:33,183
Well, I'd hate to think so,
but anything's possible.

746
00:33:33,216 --> 00:33:35,150
I'm going to go
check on him.

747
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:44,616
Okay, Seth,
we'll see you next week.

748
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,750
‐ Is your mom here?
‐ She's my foster mom.

749
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,716
‐ Okay. See you.
‐ Bye, Seth.

750
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:53,750
I'm sorry I had
to call you in.

751
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:56,350
Don't be. I'm glad you recognize
you were in over your head.

752
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:58,150
A lot of students don't
want to admit that.

753
00:33:58,183 --> 00:33:59,650
I really blew it.

754
00:33:59,683 --> 00:34:03,216
Kid like Seth, alcoholic father,
been bounced around a lot.

755
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,483
You can expect
a lot of setbacks.

756
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:05,616
They'll happen
again and again.

757
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,250
Well, I caused
this setback.

758
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:10,416
I was 20 minutes late
for our meeting today.

759
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,250
Well, that is something
that cannot happen again.

760
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:16,216
It won't.
I won't let it.

761
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:23,183
Now, from the sublime
to the utterly mundane

762
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:26,550
but then the appendectomy is
our bread and butter, isn't it?

763
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:29,483
Maybe not
if I do cardiothoracic.

764
00:34:29,516 --> 00:34:32,116
Yeah, so...what do you think?

765
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,150
I think
you're an utter bastard

766
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,216
for mentioning it to me
in front of Peter.

767
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,550
‐ He's a big boy.
‐ It was mean.

768
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,683
Oh, well, he was mean
to me first.

769
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:45,683
He led me on to think that
he wanted the cardiothoracic

770
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,350
and then he took trauma.

771
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:49,816
Nevertheless, it was bad form
to speak to one colleague

772
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,250
in front of another
about a sensitive matter.

773
00:34:52,283 --> 00:34:54,283
Geez, talk about
being sensitive.

774
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:55,650
‐ Robert.
‐ 'Donald!'

775
00:34:55,683 --> 00:34:57,416
'How was your Whipple,
you lucky dog?'

776
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,750
A long six hours,
that's how.

777
00:34:59,783 --> 00:35:02,650
Which is why I wasn't able
to find you earlier.

778
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:06,616
You initiated this, uh, code
phone system down in the ER?

779
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,650
‐ 'Yes, sir.'
‐ For what purpose?

780
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:10,616
Patients' families
can't sneak in calls

781
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,583
to their relatives
in Hoboken.

782
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,516
Which I believe
is not a big problem.

783
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,416
No, no, but you wanna know what
is? Employee personal calls.

784
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,183
'This allows us to track all
the outgoing calls internally.'

785
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:22,416
That way we don't have to wait
for the phone bills to arrive.

786
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,483
‐ So to speak.
‐ Uh, I see.

787
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:26,250
Big‐brother‐is‐watching
kind of thing.

788
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:28,150
No, monitoring might be
a better word.

789
00:35:28,183 --> 00:35:30,116
Have you so little respect
for the people who work here

790
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,550
sometimes very long hours
and not a great deal of pay?

791
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:38,083
‐ I don't see it that way.
‐ Well, I do.

792
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,783
'So if you'd be so kind
as to take your..'

793
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,816
...code phone system
and put it where the sun‐‐

794
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,316
Got it.

795
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:46,050
Good.

796
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,750
Point taken.

797
00:35:58,516 --> 00:35:59,750
That's really exciting.

798
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,550
Yeah, a new little voice
in the world.

799
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,516
Uh, but Carol actually
hasn't told anyone yet

800
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,150
so we're pretending
like we don't know.

801
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:07,116
Okay, I won't
say anything.

802
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,283
‐ Oop! Sorry!
‐ Aw, man!

803
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,616
‐ Uh, Carter..
‐ Look!

804
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,316
I'm sorry. I wanted to talk
to you about this..

805
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,816
I think it's great that
you went off the Ritalin.

806
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,383
I really do. I think
it's the right decision.

807
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,183
But I can't be holding
your hand through this.

808
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:35,750
I wouldn't be so stupid
as to ask you to.

809
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:38,216
‐ I know you're not capable.
‐ What does that mean?

810
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,650
You haven't liked me
from the get‐go.

811
00:36:39,683 --> 00:36:41,316
I've never been quite
up to your standards.

812
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,783
I just want you to be
a better student.

813
00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:45,216
‐ I want you to succeed.
‐ I know that's what you think.

814
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,516
But I think that you're
the one who wants to succeed

815
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,450
as a teacher, and..

816
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:51,516
...in order for that to happen

817
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,283
I would have to be
the perfect reflection of you

818
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:55,183
and that's not who I am.

819
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:57,150
I have a patient.

820
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:04,650
I'm dropping these off
for Dr. Weintraub.

821
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,416
Hey, Peter, I just want to
tell you I think Rocket

822
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,183
was a complete ass for doing
what he did in the OR today.

823
00:37:09,216 --> 00:37:11,150
He can do whatever
he wants.

824
00:37:11,183 --> 00:37:12,583
Yeah, well,
not entirely, but‐‐

825
00:37:12,616 --> 00:37:16,716
It doesn't matter, Elizabeth.
Cardiothoracic, trauma.

826
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,683
I don't think I care
about any of it anymore.

827
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,283
Hang on.
What do you mean?

828
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:25,850
Carla came to see me today.
She married Roger.

829
00:37:25,883 --> 00:37:28,783
She wants to take Reese
and, uh, move to Germany.

830
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:31,183
Something about
Roger's job.

831
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,583
Well, she can't.

832
00:37:32,616 --> 00:37:35,083
I mean, legally,
she can't do that, can she?

833
00:37:35,116 --> 00:37:37,816
Yeah, well, she won't
get the chance to.

834
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,750
Hey, Carol, this fax
just came in for you.

835
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,716
Thanks, Jerry.

836
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,550
‐ By the way, I know you know.
‐ Know what?

837
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:51,650
I know nothing. I'm a complete
walking lack of information.

838
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,583
‐ Oh, man.
‐ Carol, it's for you.

839
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,550
This is Carol Hathaway.

840
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,616
Yeah, you're doing
so much better, huh?

841
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,716
It's kind of a big day.

842
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,516
You want some juice?

843
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,783
I got some
apple juice here.

844
00:38:08,816 --> 00:38:12,483
My name is Kerry.
Can you tell me your name?

845
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:14,616
Jack.

846
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,283
Jack Toberen.

847
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,516
So that's your name,
little guy Jack.

848
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,416
Wow. What a great name,
Jack, huh?

849
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,750
So you got a response?

850
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:29,150
Pediatric neurosurgeon
on the north side.

851
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,783
'He recognized the photo.
He put the shunt in.'

852
00:38:31,816 --> 00:38:34,716
He saw Jack about two months ago
for a follow‐up.

853
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,183
‐ He called the parents.
‐ They're coming in?

854
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,516
Oh, yeah, in a big hurry.

855
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,116
I just spoke to the mother
on the phone.

856
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,416
Jack was kidnapped
three weeks ago.

857
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,383
‐ What?
‐ Unreal, huh?

858
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:49,216
By the nanny
and the drugged‐out boyfriend.

859
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,116
They must've been
the ones who abandoned him.

860
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,316
‐ 'I guess so.'
‐ 'There you go. Oop.'

861
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,283
I called the police.
They're on their way in.

862
00:38:56,316 --> 00:39:00,650
So now we know
who you are, Jack. Yeah.

863
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:05,116
Your mom and dad are coming in
and you get to go home.

864
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,216
Yeah.

865
00:39:07,816 --> 00:39:09,716
Alright.

866
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,216
‐ Hey, Peter.
‐ Hey, Lizette.

867
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,216
Carla won't be home
until 7:30.

868
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,150
Yeah, I know. Actually,
it might even be later.

869
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:19,116
Uh, maybe not till 10:00.
Hey, man.

870
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,850
She didn't tell me
she'd be late.

871
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:24,183
I told her I'd tell you
when I got here.

872
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:25,383
You know, I don't
have to take Reese.

873
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,850
It's just that Carla
was pretty sure

874
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,850
you would have
some plans tonight.

875
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:31,316
Oh, I was planning
to go to the Quartz Lounge.

876
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,583
Um, I‐I kind of have been
seeing this trumpet player.

877
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:35,383
‐ Oh, a musician, huh?
‐ Yeah.

878
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,350
Yeah, well, you better
watch yourself.

879
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:39,283
Say bye, Reese.

880
00:39:39,316 --> 00:39:40,816
‐ Bye‐bye, Reese.
‐ Say bye.

881
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,516
Bye‐bye.
Bye.

882
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:50,687
So is your mom more
or less pissed off

883
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,887
than I imagine she is?

884
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,120
That'd be more
or less than you?

885
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:56,420
That's fair.

886
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,220
She's acting like I'll never
play the violin again.

887
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:04,874
It's pretty funny.

888
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:07,941
I heard it
in a stupid TV movie.

889
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:09,974
What are you doing watching
TV when you got homework?

890
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,074
Oh, man, you are my mom.

891
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:16,408
I don't know about that.

892
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:19,374
See, I think I want
the best for you..

893
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:23,074
...but I suspect that
she's...does a better job

894
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:25,908
of appreciating you
for who you are.

895
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,341
As long as I grow up
to be just like her.

896
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:30,108
I know that routine.

897
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:33,041
My family wanted me to grow up
to be a rich, white guy.

898
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:35,408
Damn, they must be dancing.

899
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,308
You don't make that kind of
money in emergency medicine.

900
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:39,274
I think they figure they'd
settle on two out of three.

901
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,741
I wish I hadn't blown
that summer thing, Dr. Carter.

902
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:46,374
You'll get another chance.

903
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:49,808
I mean now I'll be spending
my time bagging groceries.

904
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:52,008
Actually, I'm not even sure
you're gonna be doing that.

905
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,741
'I'll be right here
when you get out.'

906
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,074
‐ We'll still make it.
‐ Doesn't matter.

907
00:41:02,108 --> 00:41:03,808
This is worth staying for.

908
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:04,841
Carol!

909
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:06,174
Wow, you two look great.

910
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,741
I'll walk out with you.

911
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:09,041
You know what,
I have to check on a chart.

912
00:41:09,074 --> 00:41:11,874
Oh, return a phone call.

913
00:41:11,908 --> 00:41:13,208
Okay.
Goodnight.

914
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:18,308
Surprise!

915
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,008
‐ Oh, man.
‐ 'We got you.'

916
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,908
‐ She got us.
‐ What are you doing?

917
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,641
We know you haven't officially
told us about the baby‐‐

918
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:26,408
But we couldn't sit on it
another darn minute.

919
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,941
'We just wanted you to know
how happy we are.'

920
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:30,174
And we're gonna get you
something better‐‐

921
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,308
But for now..

922
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:34,808
Oh, man! God!

923
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:37,141
Guys..

924
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:39,174
Hey, Carol,
need a Lamaze coach?

925
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,641
‐ You're it, Malik.
‐ Alright.

926
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:43,241
Yeah.
Oh, this is amazing. I, uh..

927
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:45,174
I've just been overwhelmed
with this news myself.

928
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:49,208
And, uh, today I found out
I'm‐I'm having twins.

929
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,341
‐ Wow.
‐ Hey!

930
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:54,841
So, um, I didn't know
when or how to tell people

931
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:58,741
and I'm, I'm really glad that
I can share this with you now.

932
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:00,374
‐ So thank you.
‐ Congratulations.

933
00:42:16,808 --> 00:42:18,741
'Hi, you've reached Peter.'

934
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:21,074
'If you wanna leave a message,
please do so after the tone.'

935
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,774
'Peter, are you there?'

936
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:26,208
'Is Reese there with you?'

937
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,374
'Peter.'

938
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:31,108
'Peter, what are you doing?'

939
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:34,041
'You know darn well Reese
is supposed to be here tonight.'

940
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:37,041
'Peter, if you're there,
please pick up.'

941
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:46,208
So we missed the boat.

942
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:48,708
Oh, well, cruises
are overrated anyway.

943
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,708
Shall we?

944
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:01,108
So about
what's been going on.

945
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:02,374
See, the thing is
I'm not exactly sure

946
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:04,341
what has been going on.

947
00:43:05,408 --> 00:43:07,341
What do you mean?

948
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:12,941
Look, Peter and I jumped
into something rather quickly

949
00:43:12,974 --> 00:43:15,841
and when it wasn't working,
we both jumped out.

950
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:22,108
‐ Is it still unresolved?
‐ No, no, no, it is.

951
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,141
Uh..

952
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:26,308
...the thing is you
and I have been seeing

953
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:29,208
a lot of each other
and it's, uh..

954
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,908
It's been great.

955
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:35,108
But, uh, it's not anything
that I was looking for

956
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:37,374
and it's caught me
off balance, rather

957
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:40,008
which I'm not used to.

958
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,308
It makes me
rather nervous.

959
00:43:46,074 --> 00:43:49,108
Elizabeth, I don't..

960
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:51,141
...I don't know
what's going to happen..

961
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:54,708
...but I do know
how I feel.

962
00:43:56,074 --> 00:43:58,708
And I feel like..

963
00:43:58,741 --> 00:44:00,941
...I've found something..

964
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:02,074
...amazing.

965
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:06,174
And I wanna be here.

966
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:09,608
I wanna get to know you..

967
00:44:12,308 --> 00:44:14,241
...and not be scared.

968
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:21,208
I would hate to miss
another boat.

969
00:44:23,008 --> 00:44:24,141
Mmm.
