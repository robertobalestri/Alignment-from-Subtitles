1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,066
Previously on "ER"

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,433
Thanks for covering for me.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,166
If you don't know
something, ask.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,800
Hold on, are you telling me
the EMS medical director

5
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,033
is a real person?

6
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:14,433
He's an ER doc.

7
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,466
I thought it was
just a name they

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,033
stuck on the top of memos.

9
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:18,266
Not when I do it.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,700
You're a pediatric
emergency fellow, right?

11
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,366
Yep, one rung under the boss.

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,433
You're not thinking
of starting all over again?

13
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:25,200
It's a means to what
I really want to do

14
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,333
which is to stay here.

15
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,333
I am an ER doc just like you.

16
00:00:28,366 --> 00:00:29,500
Not like me, Doug.

17
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,766
You acted without the consent

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,033
of your colleagues.

19
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,433
If Reese can't hear talking

20
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,633
or the telephone
it's a severe to profound loss.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,533
Excuse me. You going
to be in here long?

22
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,766
No, almost done. Just a minute.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,466
Why are you starting
with the copy room?

24
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,700
Got a work order.

25
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,666
Yeah, well,
other rooms in the ER

26
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,533
need paint more than this one.

27
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,533
Lady, I just do what
they tell me to do.

28
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,366
So how was your skating party?

29
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,266
You have fun?

30
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,033
Yeah.

31
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:08,600
Mostly kids from
your soccer camp?

32
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:10,633
Some.

33
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,366
Uh, Juliette?

34
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,366
It's Julienne.

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,566
And she wasn't there.

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,666
So who was there?

37
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,666
Just kids.

38
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:28,133
Hello.

39
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:30,100
Oh, hi, mom.
I just knew it was you.

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,566
Yeah.

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,566
Oh, no, I had a great time.

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,333
Oh, you'll never guess
who was there.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,300
'Well, Stephanie she had
this sort of yellow sweater.'

44
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,366
'Well, remember that time
I went to the mall with you'

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,566
'and I saw that orange sweater'

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,100
'that really matched
my blue skirt?'

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,666
'Well, this one
looks even better.'

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,766
Interim?

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,766
Yes.

50
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,333
Well, has there been any change

51
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:03,600
in my responsibilities?

52
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,066
No. It's just, around the table

53
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,666
we felt that interim
was a more accurate term.

54
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,433
So, uh, you're
the interim chief, Kerry.

55
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,766
Fine.

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,333
But you know, Don,
it has been over 90 days

57
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,266
since Dr. Morgenstern resigned.

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,100
Then policy dictates that
a permanent chief be named.

59
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,433
It's all in the process.

60
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,233
We've put out
feelers and thus far

61
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,733
we have four
outstanding candidates.

62
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,333
We're forming
a committee right now.

63
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,500
So four candidates including me?

64
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,100
Actually, you make it five.

65
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,533
Just one more thing.

66
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:41,266
You know, I did
a performance review

67
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
of Doug Ross.

68
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:44,100
You already gave me
an evaluation

69
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:45,400
of the ultra‐rapid detox.

70
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,733
Yeah, this is an overall
evaluation of his work

71
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:52,066
to help in deciding
whether he should be made

72
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,033
uh, ER pedes attending.

73
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,733
I'll pass it along.

74
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,733
Thank you.

75
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,466
Dr. Carter.

76
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,266
Ethan Luitly, remember?

77
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,333
The guy next door was playing
pumpkins at volume 11

78
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,166
‐ I couldn't study.
‐ Oh, yeah, I talked to him.

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,466
He said he'd stop.

80
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,800
The volume's down
now but I'm very sensitive‐‐

81
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,133
I'm running late.
Can we talk later?

82
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,800
'Oh God. Log jam.'

83
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,566
'Oh, dude,
it's flooding my stall.'

84
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,333
Not again.

85
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:18,366
Alright, I'll fix it.

86
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,666
Come out, I'll fix it.

87
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,500
Shut off the water
before it floods the hall.

88
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,500
No, it's quicker
to lift the lid.

89
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:27,566
Hey, I've done this before.

90
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Just pull the chain.

91
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,466
No. Maintenance says..

92
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,633
...the shut‐off valve.

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,600
'Randi, have you
seen my student?'

94
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:31,600
She was just here
looking for you.

95
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,666
What?

96
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,266
You're starting
to look kind of mythical.

97
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,566
Carter, curtain four,
LOL, weak and dizzy.

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,233
Hey, Mark, what does, uh..

99
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,633
What does interim mean to you?

100
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,666
Uh, in‐between?

101
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,133
Do you think that's
a stronger word than acting?

102
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,233
Oh, your new title?

103
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,733
I liked acting better.

104
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,100
They're forming a committee
to review candidates.

105
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:55,400
Yeah. Anspaugh told me.

106
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,200
He asked me to be on it.

107
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,766
Do you think that's a good idea?

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,700
Why not? I can be impartial.

109
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,166
But since my hat's in the ring

110
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,433
and we work together,
I‐I would hate

111
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,233
for there to be any
suggestion of favoritism.

112
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,266
You don't think I should?

113
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,400
Well, I just wanna be fair.

114
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,700
No problem. I'll pass.

115
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:16,666
Hey, sneak away for lunch?
Rosebud? On me?

116
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,600
‐ What's the occasion?
‐ A chance to talk.

117
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:19,700
About what?

118
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,066
Over lunch.

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,333
Okay, sure.

120
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,400
Hi. Is Carol around?

121
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,766
Uh, yeah. She's just..

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,066
Hey, you're back!

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,500
Yeah. I'm reborn.

124
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,600
‐ Oh, god, you look great.
‐ Thanks.

125
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,600
Where was it you went again?

126
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,166
The Laurentian Wilderness.

127
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,133
Ooh, I think I'd stay
away from any place

128
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,033
that had wilderness
attached to its name.

129
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:41,200
Actually, it was great.
I was in a music camp.

130
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:43,066
We jammed all night
long every night.

131
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,433
It was great. Rock,
salsa, gospel, whatever.

132
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,600
‐ What‐‐
‐ That kind of wild?

133
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,133
I can get with that.

134
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,300
Ah, Jeanie Boulet,
this is Lynette Evans

135
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,700
the clinic's own
nurse practitioner.

136
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,333
Oh, great. Welcome.

137
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm not on until noon, guys.

138
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:55,666
I'm just doing some paperwork

139
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,200
so if you need
some help, lemme know.

140
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,300
Volunteering?

141
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,333
Oh, you did just come straight

142
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:00,700
from the wilderness.

143
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,600
Well, here you go.

144
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,333
How about John Esmond

145
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:05,733
seven years old, losing weight

146
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,100
no insurance, curtain two?

147
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,200
‐ You got it.
‐ Thank you.

148
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,500
Hello.

149
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,700
Do you know how long
we waited out there?

150
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,166
Sorry about that.

151
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,800
Hey, John. My name is Jeanie.

152
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,233
Now, I need to put this
thermometer under your arm.

153
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,400
I want you to hold
it there for me.

154
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,133
There you go. Has he complained
of cramps or diarrhea?

155
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,100
No, but look what he threw up.

156
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,333
‐ What are those?
‐ Roundworms.

157
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:31,033
‐ 'Worms?'
‐ Yeah.

158
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,166
How's everything going?

159
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,133
Oh, you know,
back to civilization.

160
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,533
'My findings
are nearly identical'

161
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,466
'to those of the audiologist.'

162
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,533
With the results
of both tests being so close

163
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:43,333
I'd say this is
very reliable data.

164
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,100
You know,
I've been doing research

165
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,733
on the cochlear implants,
how they've restored hearing

166
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,200
to people that are totally deaf.

167
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:49,733
Yes, but implant surgery

168
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,666
requires destruction
of residual hearing.

169
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,166
Okay, but what difference
does it make

170
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,700
if the surgery will
allow him to hear?

171
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,533
Given the FDA criteria

172
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,100
he's not a candidate
at this time.

173
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,400
Your son can be helped
by less invasive methods

174
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:05,066
hearing aids.

175
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,400
The new digital hearing aids.

176
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,200
Coupled with intensive
speech therapy.

177
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,233
What about, uh, sign language?

178
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,600
Why limit him to signing
when we can teach him

179
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:15,600
to hear and speak?

180
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay.

181
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,033
So, what do we do, uh,
to get this digital hearing aid?

182
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,100
So I do this thing
with scallops

183
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,166
in a white wine sauce‐‐

184
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,733
Doug, what is this lunch about?

185
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:34,366
‐ Mm, all in good time.
‐ Why don't you just tell me?

186
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
You're terrible at keeping
secrets, come on.

187
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:37,466
No. I'm in complete control.
It's a new me.

188
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,066
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

189
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,700
What could the new you
see a kid in a clinic?

190
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,466
He's got a parasite infection.

191
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,066
I have ten minutes.
I got some paperwork.

192
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,566
‐ Okay.
‐ Is it bad?

193
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,300
Well, it might kill your
interest in the scallops.

194
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,500
Hey, I found these
in the copy machine.

195
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,566
Hey, throw that
in Dr. Ross' box.

196
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:57,366
Dr. Carter, do you remember me?

197
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,633
Roxanne? I spoke to you
at Jerry's surprise party.

198
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,400
You were selling
disability insurance.

199
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,433
Right.

200
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,466
I'm more likely to be maimed

201
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,733
than killed?

202
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,166
Sorry, I didn't mean
to pressure you.

203
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,700
Actually, I'm here today
to sign up one of your nurses

204
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:14,066
but my toe is still
a little bit sore..

205
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,133
the one I dropped the weight on?

206
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,566
Would you mind taking a look?

207
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Sure. Hop up here.

208
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,400
So, did I tell you?

209
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,133
I'm also selling
mutual funds now.

210
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,300
I just started.

211
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,700
It's such an exciting arena.

212
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,733
Ah, yeah. A little
tender right there.

213
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,366
Sorry.

214
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Are you selling straight funds

215
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:31,733
or variable annuities?

216
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,133
You know about annuities?

217
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,133
Sure. Once you max out
your Keogh

218
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,233
you need a vehicle
for tax‐deferred income.

219
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,333
Yeah, but the problem is
most people can't lock up

220
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,433
their money till retirement.

221
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,066
That's where muni bonds come in.

222
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
This is healing.

223
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,200
It's just gonna take probably

224
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,766
a little more time.

225
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Avoid stomping your feet

226
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,500
and everything
should be alright.

227
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,333
So, no slam dancing
to the beastie boys?

228
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,666
Slow dancing.

229
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,733
Well, whatever you
say, Dr. Carter.

230
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,533
Thank you.

231
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,133
'This is rather nostalgic.'

232
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,400
My last day
as a surgical fellow.

233
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,333
At least it's beginning

234
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,633
with something
rather substantial.

235
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,133
A gastroplasty on
a 400‐pound gentleman.

236
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,700
Did I make the wrong choice?

237
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:25,466
It's not for me to say.

238
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,166
Still, I wouldn't mind
hearing your opinion.

239
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:35,033
Is there some ominous portent
in that long pause?

240
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,000
I just can't imagine
being an intern again.

241
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,366
Well, I'm determined
not to whine about it

242
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,700
and I feel very good
about not leaving the hospital.

243
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,100
You might as well
take a coffee break, Peter.

244
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,166
My patient just expired
in the SICU.

245
00:09:52,366 --> 00:09:54,533
‐ What is this?
‐ Rodney McMullen, 48.

246
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,200
‐ Oh, God.
‐ Can you believe this?

247
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,633
Carving knife versus forehead.

248
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,700
But good vitals.
Amazingly, no visual complaints.

249
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,100
He's drunk, combative
and strong‐‐

250
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,533
Lucy, come on.
We got a good one.

251
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:04,800
Damn beans! You give 'em work

252
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:08,300
they don't care! Son of a bitch!

253
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,766
Alright, everybody.

254
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,566
We're going to be
nice and gentle.

255
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,500
On my count

256
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:17,133
one, two, three.

257
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,733
Pancho must die!
I'll blow his brains out!

258
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,366
Alright, hold him,
hold him down.

259
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
I got his legs.
Lucy, get his left arm.

260
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,500
I'll get the restraints.

261
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,133
CBC, chem seven

262
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,400
PT, PTT, type
and cross for two units.

263
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:30,800
Pupils are equal
and react to light.

264
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,533
‐ Sir, you gotta hold still.
‐ Just let me get up!

265
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,133
How do I tie him?

266
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,333
Once around the wrist,
twice around the frame.

267
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,700
Gram of Ancef?

268
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,066
Sir, do you have any
allergies to medicine?

269
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,366
No. Just let me up!

270
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Go with the Ancef.

271
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,733
Carol, can you get over here
and hold his head?

272
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,200
I just wanna look
at the open mouth.

273
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,500
Sir, I need to you
to open your mouth.

274
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:46,566
He's tied!

275
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,133
Okay, Lucy, take a look.

276
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,533
The tip of the blade
is in the oropharynx.

277
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,433
It's still penetrated
the frontal sinuses.

278
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:52,500
Missed the eyes completely.

279
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,666
Son of a bitch!

280
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,033
‐ 'Whoa, whoa, whoa.'
‐ Hey!

281
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:01,200
Lucy! Lucy, you tied him
to the rail, not the frame!

282
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,300
You don't listen!

283
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,533
Hey, hey, don't spit!

284
00:11:04,566 --> 00:11:07,300
Carol, give him
five of Haldol, IM.

285
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,366
Sir, don't spit!

286
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,433
Put this on.

287
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,030
Not you, Lucy, him!

288
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:20,397
Hey. Dana, this is Dr. Ross.

289
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,597
'Hi, Dana.'

290
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,697
'How are you feeling?'

291
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,764
I'm okay.

292
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:25,497
Hmm? Any more pain?

293
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,564
It's still there a little bit

294
00:11:26,597 --> 00:11:28,164
but I don't mind.

295
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,130
Oh, then, well, let's take
a look at the damage here.

296
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:33,130
Now, how exactly
did this happen?

297
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,530
I moved up for the goal

298
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,064
and had a sidekick
right in the net

299
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,097
Mm‐hmm.

300
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,130
and as soon as my foot

301
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,497
touched the ball

302
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,130
I heard a crack.

303
00:11:42,164 --> 00:11:45,097
Then I went to take a step

304
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,164
and it just gave out

305
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:47,564
and it started hurting.

306
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:50,097
Mm‐hmm. Okay, did you
collide with anybody?

307
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,730
Anybody fall on top of you?

308
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:54,530
‐ No.
‐ Anybody kick you in the shin?

309
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:55,730
No.

310
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,197
All I did was kick the ball.

311
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,697
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ What's wrong?

312
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,330
It's just that it's
a severe break.

313
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,297
I want to understand
how it happened.

314
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,330
Ah, okay, we're going to get you

315
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,530
some more pain medication

316
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,264
and we're going
to run some tests.

317
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:08,330
Alright?

318
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:09,530
Okay.

319
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,664
Okay.

320
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,130
‐ Did you see that?
‐ Yeah.

321
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:17,164
The bone looked like it exploded

322
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,430
from the inside.

323
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:21,230
Yep. I want to get
a CT‐guided needle biopsy.

324
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:22,364
Tumor?

325
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:23,664
I think there's
a remote possibility

326
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,164
it's an infection.
Did you talk to the parents?

327
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,330
Well, one of the mothers
from the soccer club

328
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:27,464
is trying to reach them.

329
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,064
We'll need their
consent for biopsy.

330
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,630
Dr. Benton, you have
a call on 3‐5.

331
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:37,997
A Mr. Davidson from
some insurance company

332
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,264
calling you back.

333
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:40,597
What is this?

334
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,230
I found that in the copy room.

335
00:12:42,264 --> 00:12:43,264
I didn't leave it there.

336
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,364
'It's got your name on it.'

337
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,430
Alright, thanks.

338
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,697
He has the same coverage I have.

339
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,397
What do you mean,
no health insurance covers it?

340
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,297
You mean, if I needed them,
you wouldn't buy them?

341
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,230
Well, that's not
acceptable. Listen..

342
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:57,964
...uh, can I speak
to your superior, please?

343
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,730
Fine. Fine, I'll call him back.

344
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,130
Problem, Peter?

345
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,697
It's just bureaucracy
drives you crazy.

346
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,997
So I'm supposed to be treating

347
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,297
this McMullen
with a knife wound?

348
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,297
Ah, It's not just
a knife wound, but no hurry.

349
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,430
I gave him five of Haldol.

350
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:14,997
Dr. Greene, a call just came

351
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,230
on a hostage crisis
and shoot‐out.

352
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:17,497
They might need
a triage officer.

353
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,597
Yeah, they probably want
somebody

354
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,097
with more experience than me.

355
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,264
You know, I start tomorrow.

356
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,330
Hey, this is the rush..

357
00:13:22,364 --> 00:13:23,430
The best part of the job.

358
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:24,764
Maybe we'll see you on TV.

359
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:26,397
‐ A shoot‐out?
‐ Yeah, wild west.

360
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,297
How about it, doc?

361
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,197
Tell Dr. Weaver
that I'm going on a run.

362
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,497
800...850...920 dollars.

363
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,997
Malik, could I ask
you a question?

364
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,530
Which do you think
is the better vein?

365
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,330
Let's see.

366
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:45,430
That's the one.

367
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:46,664
‐ Big and stringy.
‐ Good.

368
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:48,630
Just slide it in.
He can't feel anything.

369
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:49,630
Alright.

370
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,330
Going in.

371
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,530
Got a flash.

372
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,230
I'm advancing.

373
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:58,497
Sapphire pinkie ring.

374
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,730
This man ain't got no class.

375
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:02,064
Hooked up the line.

376
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:03,364
Got the tape.

377
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:08,730
How come it's not running in?

378
00:14:14,497 --> 00:14:15,764
It's infiltrated.

379
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:16,997
You went all the way
through the vein.

380
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,497
No, I was really careful.

381
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,364
Well, Lucy, you gotta be
kind of Zen with it, okay?

382
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,383
Now watch the master, okay?

383
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,617
It's not about seeing,
it's not about feeling

384
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,550
it's about knowing.

385
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,717
Malik, you got
a phone call in admit.

386
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,150
Okay, it's in.

387
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,683
‐ Okay.
‐ Now finish it up.

388
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:38,183
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I'll take it out there.

389
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,250
‐ Okay?
‐ Yep.

390
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,450
Keep an eye on this guy, too.

391
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,583
Lucy, when you finish
there's a head lac

392
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:44,650
to irrigate in curtain two.

393
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,650
Okay.

394
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,383
Wow.

395
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,117
Oh, The knife tip is posterior

396
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,650
to the uvula in the oropharynx.

397
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,450
Huh.

398
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:57,450
So, everything
under control in here?

399
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:59,717
It's fine.

400
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,650
I asked Malik for some
help with the IV

401
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:03,750
Good.

402
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,383
Use the nurses.

403
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,583
That's an important lesson.

404
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,450
We had an exchange of gunfire.

405
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:23,183
The assailant's down,
the bomb squad's checking him.

406
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:24,283
Bomb squad?

407
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:25,550
He took four employees hostage

408
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,117
with a suitcase
full of explosives.

409
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,083
‐ What's his problem?
‐ Guy works here.

410
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:31,117
I guess he didn't like it.

411
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,517
The docs are here.
How's he doing?

412
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,350
'The guy's covered in dynamite.'

413
00:15:35,383 --> 00:15:37,583
He's got chicken wire
all over his body.

414
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:40,083
Lots of blood
coming out of his neck.

415
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:41,450
How long's he been down?

416
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,183
‐ Maybe ten minutes.
‐ Can we get in there?

417
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:44,817
Not until we've cleared
the explosives.

418
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,683
Clark, can I send
a doc in there?

419
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,117
Well, I've cut the main fuse

420
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,183
but it's not safe
without a seven‐b suit.

421
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,050
‐ What's that?
‐ A bomb suit.

422
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,083
Put me in that thing.

423
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:56,483
Wait. Wait a minute.

424
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,183
If anybody goes in there,
you should go in.

425
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,417
You're the doctor.

426
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,450
I'm not trying
to put any pressure

427
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:01,483
on you, if the guy dies

428
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:03,050
it wouldn't ruin my day

429
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,517
but it just looks bad
on the evening news.

430
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,283
Sure. I'll go in.

431
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,450
‐ Jeanie, hey.
‐ Yeah?

432
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,617
The pathology about Dana

433
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,083
the full workup
will take a few days

434
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:14,117
but it looks like
Ewing's sarcoma.

435
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,250
If you wanna beg off on this‐‐

436
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,617
No, no, no I wanna help.

437
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,783
Good.

438
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:19,583
77‐year‐old female,
fell unconscious

439
00:16:19,617 --> 00:16:20,617
in her apartment.

440
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,350
Her name is Emily Holmes.

441
00:16:22,383 --> 00:16:24,683
She always said she had
very good health coverage.

442
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,717
We found her with
BP 90/60, pulse 120.

443
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,083
Started a line.

444
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:30,750
‐ She arrested en route.
‐ Any history?

445
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:32,217
No meds in the bathroom.

446
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,583
Do you know if she has
any medical problems?

447
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,150
Oh, I'm just her neighbor.

448
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:38,617
She always seemed alright,
just forgetful.

449
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,150
'Okay, let's get
her on a monitor.'

450
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:41,717
'7.5 ET tube.'

451
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,517
There were three days
of newspaper on her doormat.

452
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,417
That's how I knew
something was wrong.

453
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,550
'Alright, I'm in.'

454
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,617
'Let's bag her.'

455
00:16:49,783 --> 00:16:51,117
Hold compressions.

456
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,417
V‐fib, no pulse.

457
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,617
Charge. 200.

458
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,050
Is she dead? What's happening?

459
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,583
‐ Can I help with the‐‐
‐ Everybody clear.

460
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:58,583
Clear.

461
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:01,750
'Sinus tach.'

462
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,150
I got a pulse.

463
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:07,483
'Why do you think
she arrested?'

464
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:09,150
Uh, elderly woman,
could have had an MI

465
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,617
Could be septic, hypoxic,
electrolyte imbalance..

466
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,617
BP's 90 palp.

467
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,817
Okay, let's start
her on Dopamine

468
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,650
and let's get a 12 lead.

469
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,183
She's not out of the woods yet.

470
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:21,183
Ah...does that mean
she's going to die?

471
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,383
That's a possibility.

472
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,117
Are you in touch
with her family members?

473
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,517
Oh, I never saw anyone
come to see her.

474
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,083
I only ask because..

475
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:30,750
My sister's on a waiting list

476
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,650
for an apartment
in the building.

477
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't really understand

478
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:38,783
why a biopsy was done
for a broken leg.

479
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:40,183
We looked at the fracture.

480
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:41,217
It didn't seem
to go with the way

481
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,283
that Dana said it happened.

482
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,683
It seemed unusual.

483
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,183
How?

484
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,550
The fracture may have
been caused by a tumor.

485
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,117
‐ A tumor?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

486
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,383
'It would weaken the bone.'

487
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,450
We still have to do some tests

488
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:53,083
but the biopsy

489
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:55,550
showed blue cells,
malignant cells.

490
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,450
Are you saying she has cancer?

491
00:17:57,483 --> 00:18:00,283
Well, everything is still
in the diagnostic stage.

492
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,083
So you don't know, you're
not certain about anything.

493
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:04,517
Well, the indication is
that there's a sarcoma

494
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,717
so we're gonna have you
speak with an oncologist.

495
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,783
Oh, no. I don't believe this.

496
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,717
Now, here she is.

497
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,483
Hey, honey, how you feeling?

498
00:18:13,517 --> 00:18:15,650
Ah, did you hear
how it happened?

499
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:17,417
It was so stupid..

500
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,017
'I'm sure you
played a hard game.'

501
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,583
'How much longer?'

502
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:26,717
We got detonators,
all this damn wire..

503
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,817
I hate amateurs.

504
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,617
Wacko must have spent
hours wrapping this.

505
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,717
Ah, God...his guts.

506
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,283
His guts are coming
out of this stuff.

507
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,717
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't cut anymore, okay?

508
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,283
Okay, that's small intestine.

509
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,617
Well, it's all wrapped up
in the wire.

510
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,350
Alright, listen,
his pulse is getting weaker.

511
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:46,783
We gotta get him to the ER

512
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:48,650
Is that black box a bomb?

513
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:49,683
Uh, probably not.

514
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:50,717
I got rid of the dynamite

515
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,150
but let's play it safe.

516
00:18:52,183 --> 00:18:53,583
We'll wrap him up
in a ballistic blanket.

517
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,517
If anything blows, no one gets
hurt except Boris here.

518
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,617
Okay, Zadro.

519
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,350
'Get the gurney down here now.'

520
00:18:59,383 --> 00:19:02,050
'We're moving him out.'

521
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:05,683
Dr. Olivas said that with
these digital hearing aids

522
00:19:05,717 --> 00:19:07,717
basically he'll be able
to understand and talk

523
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,650
as well as you and I.

524
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,083
So he won't be deaf?

525
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:12,483
Well, his residual hearing
is something

526
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:14,817
that we can work with, you know

527
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,450
if he, you know,
does the treatment

528
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,117
twice a week for an hour

529
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,450
but one of us has to
be there with him.

530
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,283
‐ I can do that.
‐ Yeah, well, so can I.

531
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:26,683
I mean, this treatment,
it's natural‐hearing input.

532
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,217
Basically, the more
we talk to him

533
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,050
the better his speech
will develop.

534
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,583
It's going to be okay, honey.

535
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,783
You hear that?
You're going to be okay.

536
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:36,050
Of course he is.

537
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,417
Yeah!

538
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,650
There is one thing, though.

539
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:40,083
Um, this hearing aid

540
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,317
is expensive,
and I just found out

541
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,050
that my insurance
won't cover it.

542
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,083
‐ Why won't they?
‐ They don't cover anybody.

543
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,050
That way, they don't have
to pay for the elderly.

544
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,483
Oh, that's so low.

545
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:51,283
Yeah. I hate asking this, but..

546
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,217
this thing is $5,000 and I've
only got 2,700 in the bank

547
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,517
so I was..

548
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,050
Peter, I said that
we share everything

549
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,350
and I meant everything, okay?

550
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:04,583
That means we share everything.

551
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:06,450
Don't worry about it, alright?

552
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:10,150
'Let's just be happy that
something can be done, okay?'

553
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:16,217
Hey.

554
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,550
pH 7.32, PO2 345 on 100%.

555
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,350
Good. Good, turn down to 50%

556
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:26,183
and check another gas
in a half an hour.

557
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:27,217
Okay.

558
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,617
Is this Emily Holmes?

559
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,417
Yes.

560
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,383
John Carter.

561
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,383
She was found in her apartment.

562
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:37,183
Margo Aikin, I authorize
admissions for Blue Beacon

563
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:39,083
her HMO

564
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:40,217
This lady's a DNR.

565
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:45,283
She came in full arrest.

566
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:46,783
She didn't have any papers.

567
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:48,183
'Or any family.'

568
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:51,717
Let's, uh, step outside.

569
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,150
I don't know what your plans are

570
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:54,717
but I can't admit her.

571
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,517
This patient's critical.

572
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,750
Dr. Carter, I can't
justify an expenditure

573
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:02,283
of $5,000 a day on a patient
who should not be alive

574
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,317
who does not want to be alive.

575
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,350
Well, I wasn't
gonna let her die.

576
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:08,050
That's not what we do here.

577
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,150
Her choice was not
to be resuscitated.

578
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,483
That's what is in the HMO file.

579
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,083
That's the guideline
I have to follow.

580
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:16,117
Look, She's on a vent.
You have to take her.

581
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,650
No, I don't.

582
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:19,550
You tubed her, you take her.

583
00:21:26,483 --> 00:21:27,550
'Four units O‐neg.'

584
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,250
What's his airway?

585
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:32,383
‐ Intubated in the field.
‐ Hey, what's going on?

586
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,517
GSW, bomb squad's
coming with him.

587
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,317
Bomb squad?

588
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,350
'That's the guy
with the dynamite?'

589
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:38,650
'They took it off him.'

590
00:21:38,683 --> 00:21:40,150
‐ Yeah, should be safe.
‐ Should be safe?

591
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:41,250
Gunshot wound to
the neck and abdomen.

592
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,250
Last BP was 100 palp.

593
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:44,517
Very gently, on my count.

594
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,417
One, two, three.

595
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,517
Open this blanket nice and easy.

596
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,183
Ho‐ho, eviscerated bowel.

597
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,583
CBC, chem panels

598
00:21:56,617 --> 00:21:58,817
coags, type and cross
for four. Let's move.

599
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,183
Gram of Cefotetan.

600
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:01,550
Pressure's down to 85 systolic.

601
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,117
I'll throw in a Subclavian.

602
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,217
‐ You want O negative?
‐ Yeah. Hang two units.

603
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,517
'His bowel's wrapped around'

604
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,417
this chicken wire..
What is this box?

605
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,450
It might be a detonator?
I don't know till I open it up.

606
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,050
Can that thing go off?

607
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,317
Well, It might
have a blasting cap.

608
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,050
Just don't mess with it.
You should be fine.

609
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,483
Alright, Jeanie,
Let's irrigate with saline.

610
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,650
Let's get some sterile lap pads.

611
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,450
Come on, oh, man,
we're going to have to resect

612
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:24,517
this whole mess up in the OR.

613
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,150
You, you're coming with us.

614
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:29,050
Alright, Someone get
scrubs for Officer Clark.

615
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,250
Okay, I'm in.
Hook me up. Pulse ox 98.

616
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,517
Lemme get this under there.

617
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,117
Okay, Come on,
come on. Clean it out.

618
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,117
'Good.'

619
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,683
Hey, hey, that thing's shorting!

620
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:37,817
'You got about five seconds!'

621
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,483
'Everybody out of here!'

622
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:40,783
‐ Out! Now!
‐ Let's go!

623
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,050
2,000!

624
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,183
3,000!

625
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:45,217
4,000!

626
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,350
Alright!

627
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:03,517
We've got an open bowel in here!

628
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,550
Let's move, people!

629
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,617
Let's get him up to the OR!

630
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,717
Let's go!

631
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:13,383
Here you go.

632
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,717
So, this is shrimp

633
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,583
and what's the red
shredded stuff?

634
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,517
Uh, that's Maui onions.

635
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,683
No, uh, pepperoni,
cheese, tomatoes‐‐

636
00:23:20,717 --> 00:23:23,583
It's gourmet pizza. The mad
bomber spoiled my gourmet lunch.

637
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:26,717
So, so, the heroics
give you an appetite?

638
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,050
Uh, no. The running from the
trauma room gave me an appetite.

639
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:32,517
‐ Doug..
‐ Hmm?

640
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,783
'What is this lunch about?'

641
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:35,117
Yeah, what's going on?

642
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,183
Alright, okay.

643
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,483
First, a reading.

644
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:40,683
Uh, "Performance review,
Dr. Douglas Ross

645
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:42,283
"by Kerry Weaver, MD"

646
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,650
Where did you get that?

647
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:46,483
Oh, it was found
in the copy machine.

648
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:49,217
Uh, "Dr. Ross
repeatedly demonstrates

649
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,283
"a complete disregard for
hospital policies

650
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:52,550
"and procedures.

653
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,317
'It's a, Okay, here it is.'

654
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,417
'Uh, "In spite of'

"Dr. Ross exhibits ongoing
problems with impulse control."

658
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,383
that's right, Kerry,
I'm a psycho.

659
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:10,217
Doug, she could've given that
to the pedes review committee.

660
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,217
Mm‐hmm. It's too late.

661
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,117
'Cause I brought you here
'cause I wanted you to toast

662
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,317
the new pedes ER
attending, me.

663
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:20,683
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

664
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:22,183
Buddy of mine
is on the committee

665
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,550
and told me
at 6 a. m. this morning.

666
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,383
I'm approved.
They're telling Anspaugh

667
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:26,750
right now at a faculty lunch.

668
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:28,550
I am so proud of you.

669
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,650
I am so thrilled.

670
00:24:29,683 --> 00:24:30,650
Aren't you thrilled?

671
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,383
He's got his doubts
a little bit, right?

672
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,583
Hey..

673
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:37,683
whatever my doubts were

674
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,617
in all honesty

675
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,217
I'm very happy for you.

676
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,317
Happy for both of you.

677
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,583
oh, uh...Mark, Rachel's here.

678
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,350
She wants to see you.

679
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:51,350
Sure.

680
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,083
She seems a little upset.

681
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:57,683
Hey, honey, what's up?

682
00:24:57,717 --> 00:24:59,150
Dad, can you come outside?

683
00:24:59,183 --> 00:25:01,717
‐ There's sort of a problem.
‐ Yeah.

684
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,783
I knew he wasn't feeling
right when we left vermillion

685
00:25:03,817 --> 00:25:06,683
and we got a rodeo
in Louisville 8 a. m. tomorrow.

686
00:25:06,717 --> 00:25:08,317
It's colic for sure,
'cause I ain't seen

687
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,383
a load in over 12 hours.

688
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,417
Don't worry.
My dad can help him.

689
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,650
He's a doctor.

690
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:16,150
Honey, I'm not a vet.

691
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,617
Last time he got impacted

692
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,117
mineral oil enema did the trick.

693
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,117
We just don't have the
facilities here to treat animals

694
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,050
but if you come inside,
I'm sure we can find you a vet.

695
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,150
Nearest large animal
man's in buffalo grove.

696
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:29,417
That's two hours
in this traffic.

697
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,383
Dad, you got to
help him, please?

698
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:34,617
He's one of the finest
roping horses there is.

699
00:25:37,717 --> 00:25:39,317
Poor thing.

700
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,717
If he goes down
in the trailer, he could die.

701
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,683
That's right, miss.
He sure could.

702
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,050
That'd be tragic.

703
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,450
What's his name?

704
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:49,517
Cherry Blossom.

705
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,817
Say hi, Cherry.

706
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,683
Hi, cherry.

707
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,217
Don't worry. My dad's
gonna make you all better.

708
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,083
It's clean.
There's no money in tobacco

709
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,650
polluting chemicals, mining..

710
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:01,683
it's like giving money
to a charity

711
00:26:01,717 --> 00:26:03,350
but it's an investment.

712
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:05,450
‐ It's called a White Hat Fund.
‐ And what's the return?

713
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:09,217
Well, over the past five years,
it's been about 7.9%.

714
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,117
You got anything that's maybe
dirtier with a better upside?

715
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,450
Sure. Here you go.

716
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:16,550
Pure petrochemicals,
17.4% return.

717
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,317
‐ Alright.
‐ Dr. Carter?

718
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,617
My toe is feeling
so much better

719
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,650
since you retaped it.

720
00:26:20,683 --> 00:26:22,050
Oh, good.

721
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,083
Yeah, I was wondering
if you and I could

722
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:24,117
get together sometime

723
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,150
maybe a little hot talk

724
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,050
about dollar‐cost averaging.

725
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,717
Well, I tell you, I'm really not
much of a customer these days.

726
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,750
This isn't really a sales pitch.

727
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:32,817
You work out?

728
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,183
Um...yeah.

729
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,783
I mean, when I,
when I can find the time.

730
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:38,517
Well, it's hard to find
the time, but look

731
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,650
I get free passes for myself
and a guest to the Artemis club.

732
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,817
That's good for one
workout and a sauna.

733
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,417
I'm there every night about 7.

734
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,383
Thanks. Be careful
with your toe.

735
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:50,050
Yeah. Yeah, just exercycle,
light weights

736
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,617
you know, great therapy
after a hard day

737
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,550
but it's much more fun
when someone else is there.

738
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,117
‐ Makes the time fly.
‐ Sure.

739
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,217
Well, today is not really
a good day for me.

740
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,050
Um...but some other time,
I'll come by.

741
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,217
Whenever.

742
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,317
Is that moving any air?

743
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,650
Pulse ox 88.

744
00:27:04,683 --> 00:27:06,717
We gotta tube him.
How much do you weigh?

745
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,150
Two‐sixty.

746
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,450
Yosh, 180 of Ketamine,
180 of Sux.

747
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:12,350
Connie, 8.0 ET.

748
00:27:12,383 --> 00:27:13,383
I can't breathe.

749
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,617
Tad, we need to put a tube

750
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,283
in your throat
to help you breathe.

751
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:19,083
We'll give you medicine to make
you sleep. Try to relax.

752
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,050
‐ Meds on board.
‐ Let's put him down.

753
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,450
Connie, we need a vent in here.

754
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:25,750
‐ I need suction.
‐ Pulse ox is falling, 85.

755
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:29,217
I don't really need
this distraction.

756
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,483
Yosh, give me crichoid pressure.

757
00:27:33,517 --> 00:27:35,417
Damn, I can't see the cords.

758
00:27:38,217 --> 00:27:40,783
Bag him. Connie, give me
a number four Macintosh.

759
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,317
His neck's too big.

760
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,783
Pulse ox 89.

761
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:45,317
We don't have
a number four blade.

762
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,583
Anesthesia will have one.

763
00:27:47,617 --> 00:27:49,483
‐ 'He's paralyzed.'
‐ Yeah, keep bagging him.

764
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,483
His pulse ox is up to 90.

765
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:54,417
Dr. Greene, they sent
this down from surgery.

766
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,483
Can I keep it?

767
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,083
Uh, we'd better keep that here.

768
00:27:57,117 --> 00:27:59,117
The cops will want it.
Hey, how's it going?

769
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,417
Oh, Weaver's having trouble with
an intubation in trauma two.

770
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,450
Needs a bigger blade.

771
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,750
‐ Is everything okay?
‐ Status asthmaticus.

772
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:12,750
Needs intubation. Bull neck so
I sent for a number four blade.

773
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:14,183
Mind if I take a look?

774
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:16,050
Could deprive him
of oxygen, Mark.

775
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:20,550
Okay.

776
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,150
Okay, yeah, you're right.

777
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:24,717
It's a tough one.

778
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,183
Yosh, crichoid pressure.

779
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,650
We tried that.

780
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,117
Pulse ox is falling.

781
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,417
‐ 'Get out, Mark.'
‐ Okay.

782
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,150
Backwards. Upwards.

783
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,183
To the right.

784
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:35,517
I can see.

785
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,017
Good. Okay, I'm in.

786
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,383
Bag him.

787
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:42,550
Don't let them bag him too fast.

788
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,017
He's got a long
expiratory phase.

789
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:48,383
‐ Dr. Weaver?
‐ Yes.

790
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,450
They told me
that you could sign off

791
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,717
on this work order.

792
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,783
Where did you put
the copy machine?

793
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,117
It's not going back in there.

794
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,183
They're gonna convert

795
00:28:54,217 --> 00:28:55,617
that room to a pediatric exam.

796
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,417
See, we're taking out a wall.

797
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,483
Look real good.

798
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:01,383
Thank you.

799
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,317
‐ Dr. Weaver?
‐ What do you want, Carter?

800
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,350
I wanted to tell you
what's going on

801
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:05,383
with that patient in trauma one.

802
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:06,517
Yeah, why is she still here?

803
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,083
‐ We need the bed.
‐ I know.

804
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:09,117
I tried to get her
admitted to the unit

805
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,817
but it turns out she's a DNR.

806
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,483
And her HMO doctor was here but
she won't authorize admission.

807
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,183
If she can't stay in the ER

808
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:15,817
either get her admitted
or get her transferred.

809
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,183
Well, she's, she's intubated
so she's not stable‐‐

810
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,317
You know what, Carter, if you
wanna be a chief resident

811
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,717
you can't continue to run to
me when things don't work out.

812
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,183
Deal with this yourself.

813
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:26,417
Improve your
problem‐solving skills.

814
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,483
Randi, get me Dr. Anspaugh.

815
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,217
Hello, Peter.

816
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,117
Hey.

817
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,483
I suppose we should talk.

818
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,817
Elizabeth, this isn't
a good time for me.

819
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,317
Yeah, I know. I know

820
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,350
it's been, um..
It's been a rough day

821
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,683
with the bomber and, uh..

822
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,083
I'd like to get something
out in the open.

823
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:04,817
I know it's not been easy
being with me, but, uh..

824
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,050
if it's not working out

825
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,083
and if you and Carla

826
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:08,317
are getting back together

827
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,717
I'd appreciate hearing
it from you.

828
00:30:10,817 --> 00:30:12,583
What?

829
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:15,550
What are you..

830
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,217
Elizabeth, it's got
nothing to do with that.

831
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,250
Well, you've been avoiding me,
so what's happened?

832
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:21,683
I haven't been avoiding you.

833
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,417
I've just got some things
to deal with, okay?

834
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,583
Well, what things? What is it?

835
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:31,683
Reese is hearing impaired.

836
00:30:34,217 --> 00:30:36,083
‐ How bad?
‐ He's profoundly deaf.

837
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,150
Peter, I'm so sorry.

838
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:44,383
Listen, I didn't
tell you about it

839
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,650
because it's private.

840
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,317
And I haven't been
avoiding you, Elizabeth.

841
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,783
It's just that, you know what?

842
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,650
I don't know
how to talk about that.

843
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,783
'Easy, boy. Easy, boy.'

844
00:31:02,817 --> 00:31:04,517
How's he doing, Rachel?

845
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,083
He's okay.

846
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:08,450
Have you been
around horses much?

847
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,750
'Sure got a way with them.'

848
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,383
Okay, keep him nice and still.

849
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,050
I'm gonna put the tube in now.

850
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,283
Jerry, if you can hold the tail.

851
00:31:14,317 --> 00:31:15,283
Just..

852
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,183
Okay, easy. Easy, boy.

853
00:31:21,117 --> 00:31:23,550
Okay, good. Tube's in.

854
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:25,750
Uh...Jerry,
why don't you go ahead

855
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,150
and squeeze the lavage bag.

856
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,483
I'm not going
to get kicked, am I?

857
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:33,317
Kicked? No.
He's as sweet as they come.

858
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,417
Nice and easy.

859
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,450
Don't worry, boy.

860
00:31:35,483 --> 00:31:37,117
'We're not going to hurt you.'

861
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,717
Nothing's going to come
shooting out of his...

862
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,517
No, it shouldn't, you know.

863
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,317
Not for a while.

864
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,517
Okay. Here it goes.

865
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,783
Nice and easy.

866
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:48,617
Good.

867
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,617
'Nice even flow.'

868
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,183
Hey. How you doing?

869
00:31:56,817 --> 00:31:58,650
What's an oncologist?

870
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,317
It's a doctor that deals
with abnormal cell growth.

871
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,383
It's a cancer doctor.

872
00:32:07,195 --> 00:32:08,595
Why can't you be honest with me?

873
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,295
My parents were talking to an
oncologist outside the room.

874
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:18,662
He said something about

875
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:21,362
amputation.

876
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:23,462
They're with him right now.

877
00:32:23,495 --> 00:32:26,062
There were indications
in your biopsy.

878
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:27,195
You may have a tumor.

879
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,162
That means
they'll cut off my leg?

880
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:39,562
Specialists are gonna
look at all their options

881
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:42,562
and then make a decision soon.

882
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:44,362
Stop ducking my questions.

883
00:32:45,362 --> 00:32:46,595
Can't you be honest?

884
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:50,228
Alright.

885
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:54,228
Okay. Amputation
offers us the best choice.

886
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:56,162
I don't want to live
without my leg.

887
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:57,462
I'd rather be dead.

888
00:32:57,495 --> 00:32:59,162
They haven't finished diagnosis.

889
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:01,428
They're gonna talk about
all available treatments.

890
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,028
Treatments that could
save my leg?

891
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,228
The kind of tumor
that you have..

892
00:33:08,495 --> 00:33:11,128
Amputation offers us
the best chance.

893
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,228
If they amputate

894
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,862
is it certain I'll live?

895
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:23,295
No.

896
00:33:26,262 --> 00:33:27,928
'But it's your
best shot, kiddo.'

897
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:32,528
'If you were my daughter'

898
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:35,228
I would try to persuade
you to do it.

899
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,428
Would you still do it
if I said no?

900
00:33:45,495 --> 00:33:46,595
When you get all the facts.

901
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:50,295
Then it's a decision
that you and your parents

902
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,928
are gonna have to make together.

903
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,262
okay?

904
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:06,628
You have power of attorney
for over 700 clients?

905
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,562
So you've never
actually even met her.

906
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:13,628
Yes.

907
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,362
Yeah, any information that you..

908
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:17,462
Could you fax it over?

909
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,195
I guess that's what we'll do.

910
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:21,262
Thank you very much.

911
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,628
Everything okay, Carter?

912
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,228
Hmm..

913
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,462
Yeah, I intubated a DNR Patient.

914
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:30,428
HMO won't admit her. No family.

915
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:34,562
Only a lawyer with durable power
and he's never even met her.

916
00:34:34,595 --> 00:34:36,162
What are you thinking about?

917
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,995
I don't know.

918
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:39,962
I mean, should I extubate?

919
00:34:41,062 --> 00:34:42,428
It just seems kind of wrong.

920
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:45,128
DNR means she did not
want heroic measures.

921
00:34:45,162 --> 00:34:47,962
The real question is whether
or not you're ready to do it.

922
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:51,395
Have you ever done it?

923
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:54,028
Yeah. Once,
but I had family support.

924
00:35:09,062 --> 00:35:11,062
Her vitals are stable.
Pulse ox 98.

925
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:12,995
I've weaned her
off the Dopamine.

926
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,062
I'm going to, uh..

927
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:16,528
...turn off the vent.

928
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:18,395
Do an apnea test.

929
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:19,662
Should I get an attending?

930
00:35:19,695 --> 00:35:21,028
I already talked to Dr. Greene.

931
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:24,228
She's a DNR.

932
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:28,328
She didn't want this.

933
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:45,295
Spontaneous respiration.

934
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:47,228
Just one breath.
That might be it.

935
00:35:49,962 --> 00:35:51,628
No. She's breathing on her own.

936
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:52,995
I'm going to extubate.

937
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,295
Let's give her
five liters of oxygen.

938
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,462
Hey, any luck?

939
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:29,662
Dr. Greene wants
an enema update.

940
00:36:29,695 --> 00:36:32,095
Nah, No movement yet.

941
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,395
I'm learning all about
taking care of horses.

942
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:37,428
You know, it might not hurt
to let him out a bit.

943
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,128
Let him walk around. I mean...

944
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:41,495
...movement's good for colic.

945
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:42,995
You wanna get
in there and just, uh

946
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:44,062
give him a pat,
help me ease him out?

947
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:46,428
Uh...well, I..

948
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:49,428
I don't have
any experience with horses.

949
00:36:49,462 --> 00:36:51,595
I‐I‐I never even touched
one before today.

950
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,028
Look, you're gonna be fine.
Just don't let him

951
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:54,562
know you're scared
and don't worry

952
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,162
about showing him
who's boss, alright?

953
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,395
Come on now, Blossom.

954
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:02,395
You got all these nice
folks concerned about you.

955
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,962
'Let's go. Come on.'

956
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:05,462
'Come on.'

957
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:07,295
Come on. Come on, good boy.

958
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,462
'Come on.'

959
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:16,095
'Hey now.'

960
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,462
You brought us
some good luck, son.

961
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:23,295
Hey, Mark.

962
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,995
Can...can we talk?

963
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:26,462
Uh, I was just going
out to see the horse.

964
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,562
Yeah. It's, uh, it's important.

965
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:30,328
What's up, Kerry?

966
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:31,395
Let's go in the lounge.

967
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:36,928
Did you know that Doug Ross
was made a pedes attending?

968
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:40,395
That they're fixing up
a suite of rooms for him?

969
00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:43,295
Yeah, he told me at lunch.

970
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,362
Really. Oh, well, uh..

971
00:37:45,395 --> 00:37:46,895
I was told by the painters.

972
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,362
I had to read it on a work form.

973
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,595
Wh‐wh‐what's going
on around here?

974
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:51,628
What do you mean?

975
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:54,262
Why was I left out of the loop?

976
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:57,462
Kerry, Ross is
the new pedes ER attending.

977
00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:59,295
That's a fact of life.

978
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:00,395
We should learn to accept it

979
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:02,662
and move on, okay?

980
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:05,062
Wait a...but how can I move on

981
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:07,462
when you express disfavor

982
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,962
about Ross as an
attending to my face

983
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:13,528
and then celebrate his dubious
achievement behind my back?

984
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:15,028
Is this really about Ross?

985
00:38:15,062 --> 00:38:16,195
Yes.

986
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:17,595
Yes, it's about Ross.

987
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,028
Bottom line, I don't
think he's qualified.

988
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:22,195
The hospital doesn't agree.

989
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:23,962
And, you know, I don't think
you're angry about Ross.

990
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,962
I think this is more about you
obsessing over some silly title.

991
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,528
I wish you'd make
a decision, Kerry.

992
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:32,062
You wanna be a doctor
or an administrator?

993
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:33,462
I'm gonna go examine a horse.

994
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,328
I finished my write‐ups
on the chest pain

995
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:41,995
the altered mental status
and the ankle sprain.

996
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,862
I need you to co‐sign
these charts before I go.

997
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:46,262
Yeah.

998
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,062
Are those PVCs?

999
00:38:52,362 --> 00:38:54,162
That's right.

1000
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,462
Shouldn't we give
something for that?

1001
00:38:58,428 --> 00:38:59,395
No.

1002
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,662
'V‐tach.'

1003
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:03,995
You shock that, right?

1004
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:08,328
Not this time.

1005
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:19,895
Watch. V‐tach.

1006
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,328
'V‐fib.'

1007
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,195
Then asystole.

1008
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:29,895
She's not suffering.
It's what she wanted.

1009
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,328
I'll sign those charts now.

1010
00:40:05,595 --> 00:40:07,662
Dr. Ross.

1011
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,495
Our daughter said you spoke
to her about her treatment.

1012
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:12,228
She's very upset. Why would
you do something like that?

1013
00:40:12,262 --> 00:40:14,262
You had no right to advise
her against amputation.

1014
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,995
I didn't advise
against amputation.

1015
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:17,928
I told her it offered
the best chance to survive.

1016
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:20,162
Yeah, but you gave her
other alternatives.

1017
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:21,528
We want her to live.

1018
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:22,995
I want her to live

1019
00:40:23,028 --> 00:40:24,028
but she's going
to have to accept

1020
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,062
what's going to happen to her

1021
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,595
not end up fighting some edict

1022
00:40:26,628 --> 00:40:27,628
that gets handed down.

1023
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:28,895
No, no, no.

1024
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,162
This is our decision, not hers.

1025
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:31,228
She's 15 years old.
She's old enough

1026
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,662
to be involved in decisions

1027
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:35,262
about her own health.

1028
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,628
Stay away from her.

1029
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:40,428
You don't speak
to her again, understood?

1030
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:41,895
All right.

1031
00:40:41,928 --> 00:40:43,395
To survive,
she needs your support.

1032
00:40:43,428 --> 00:40:45,528
She has to feel
that you are working for her

1033
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:46,562
not against her.

1034
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:50,362
Let's go.

1035
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,095
So, on search committee
for chief

1036
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,162
have you set the calendar
for meetings?

1037
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:04,328
Yes, and I was sorry to get
your message this morning

1038
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:06,362
that you won't have time
to be part of the process.

1039
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:10,028
Well, actually, I've been
able to make some room.

1040
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:11,595
Really. Well, we're
getting together

1041
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:14,895
Tuesdays and Thursdays
at 6 p. m., if you can make it.

1042
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:16,528
Yes, I would like
to be involved.

1043
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:17,528
Good.

1044
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:20,995
I've lived in worse
places than this.

1045
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:23,362
It just needs some fresh
paint, some posters..

1046
00:41:23,395 --> 00:41:26,362
I can live anywhere
as long as I've got music.

1047
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:27,628
You sure you're up for this?

1048
00:41:27,662 --> 00:41:29,262
I told you
I worked for best buy.

1049
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:30,562
I assembled systems
all day long.

1050
00:41:30,595 --> 00:41:31,962
Come on, what have you got?

1051
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,995
Bose, top of the line.

1052
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:38,162
It's a very expensive system.

1053
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:39,628
I guess these are the, um..

1054
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,462
...these are the cables
that go with that?

1055
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:43,528
Oh, actually,
those are RCA cables.

1056
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:46,228
You must have hooked up
your VCR through your amplifier.

1057
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,962
I don't know.

1058
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:50,328
Some guy just came to my
apartment and hooked it all up.

1059
00:41:50,362 --> 00:41:51,362
Huh.

1060
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:02,662
You got a CD?
We could try this out.

1061
00:42:02,695 --> 00:42:03,995
Yeah, sure.

1062
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,628
