CM,02,09,CMS02E09,1,0,"The episode contains a single, relatively brief but significant scene dealing directly with abortion. In this scene, April, who is pregnant and Catholic, is told by her partner that they need to consider termination due to potential risks to her health and the baby's quality of life. April immediately rejects the idea, citing her faith, while her partner asserts his right to discuss the matter. The conversation is emotionally charged but does not resolve in favor of either position. The episode neither frames abortion as an unequivocal right nor as an absolute wrong; it presents the conflict between bodily autonomy, parental rights, religious conviction, and fetal well-being without clear narrative endorsement of either the pro-life or pro-choice stance. The rest of the episode does not revisit the issue or use it to make a broader ethical or political statement. Thus, the overall stance is neutral/balanced, as per the scale's definition of 0.","The episode does not give overriding moral weight to the fetus, nor does it frame abortion as ethically inadmissible, shameful, or only permissible in extreme cases. While April's Catholicism and immediate rejection of abortion are presented, her partner's perspective is also given space, and the narrative does not clearly side with her or depict abortion as a moral failing.","The episode does not affirm abortion as a right, nor does it prioritize the pregnant individual's autonomy above all else. The discussion is cut short by April's refusal, and the text does not frame abortion as a legitimate or positive option, nor does it minimize the fetus's moral status. There is no narrative push toward validating or normalizing abortion as would be required for a +1 or higher."
CM,02,09,CMS02E09,2,0,"The episode contains a single, brief but significant conversation about abortion between April and Tate, prompted by a possible fetal abnormality and the risk of the mother's TB medication affecting the pregnancy. The dialogue presents both perspectives: Tate raises the possibility of termination for medical reasons, emphasizing concern for April's health and the baby's quality of life, while April, identifying as Catholic, immediately rejects the idea of abortion, asserting her moral and religious stance. The conversation is emotionally charged but does not resolve in favor of either position; instead, it acknowledges the conflict between bodily autonomy, health, and moral/religious values. The episode does not advocate for or against abortion, nor does it frame either choice as clearly right or wrong. This balanced, non-committal treatment aligns with the '0' (Neutral / Balanced) score, as it presents the issue as complex and contested, without a dominant narrative bias.","The episode does not consistently foreground the fetus's moral status or present abortion as ethically inadmissible. While April's Catholic beliefs are stated, the script gives equal space to Tate's concerns for her health and the baby's well-being, and does not frame the pro-life stance as the clear or only ethical position. There is no overarching pro-life advocacy or minimization of the pregnant individual's context, which would be necessary for a -1 or lower score.","The episode does not lean toward validating abortion as a legitimate or preferable option. Although Tate suggests discussing it, April's immediate and firm refusal, rooted in her values, is not challenged or undermined by the narrative. There is no discursive support for reproductive autonomy as paramount, nor is abortion portrayed as a right or as ethically unproblematic. The text does not meet the criteria for a +1 or higher score."
CM,02,09,CMS02E09,3,0,"The episode contains a single, relatively brief but significant scene in which the topic of abortion is discussed between April and Tate. The conversation arises due to concerns about fetal development potentially linked to April's TB medication. Tate raises the possibility of termination if the baby's health or April's is at risk, but April, citing her Catholic faith, refuses to consider abortion. The dialogue gives space to both perspectives: Tate's concern for both April and the baby's quality of life, and April's moral and religious conviction. However, the episode does not resolve the issue, advocate for one side, or dwell extensively on abortion as a social or political issue. Instead, it presents the emotional and ethical conflict without clear narrative endorsement of either pro-life or pro-choice positions. This balanced, non-advocacy approach fits the '0' (Neutral / Balanced) score, as the text acknowledges the complexity and weight of both perspectives without privileging one.","The episode does not predominantly emphasize the fetus’s moral status or frame abortion as ethically inadmissible. While April’s refusal is rooted in her faith, the narrative does not present this as the only valid or dominant stance, nor does it minimize Tate’s concerns or the legitimacy of discussing abortion. There is no overarching pro-life advocacy or portrayal of abortion as nearly always unacceptable.","The episode does not lean toward validating abortion as a legitimate or preferable option. While Tate raises the possibility, the narrative does not support or encourage the choice, nor does it frame abortion as a right or focus on the pregnant individual's autonomy as paramount. The discussion is left unresolved, and the episode does not advocate for reproductive freedom or present abortion as ethically or socially justified."
CM,02,09,CMS02E09,4,0,"The episode contains a significant scene in which April and Tate discuss the possibility of abortion due to medical concerns about the fetus, specifically a potential neural tube defect possibly linked to TB medication. The conversation is emotionally charged: Tate raises the option of termination if the baby's health or April's is at risk, while April, citing her Catholic faith, firmly rejects abortion. The scene gives both perspectives space—Tate's concern for both April and the baby's quality of life, and April's moral and religious objection. The dialogue does not resolve in favor of either stance, nor does the episode as a whole advocate for or against abortion. Instead, it presents the conflict as a difficult, nuanced decision, acknowledging both the pregnant individual's autonomy and the moral status of the fetus. No other parts of the episode foreground abortion, and the narrative does not return to the issue with a clear resolution or advocacy. This balanced, multi-perspective treatment aligns with the '0' (Neutral / Balanced) category.","The episode does not predominantly emphasize the fetus's moral status or frame abortion as ethically inadmissible. While April's Catholic beliefs are clear, the script allows Tate to voice the pro-choice perspective without dismissing or minimizing it. There is no overarching pro-life framing or narrative condemnation of abortion, which would be required for a -1 or lower score.","The episode does not lean toward validating abortion as a legitimate or preferable option. Although Tate raises the possibility, the narrative does not support or affirm the choice to terminate, nor does it subordinate fetal considerations to personal autonomy. April's refusal is given equal narrative weight, and the episode does not present abortion as a right or as ethically uncomplicated, as would be necessary for a +1 or higher score."
CM,02,09,CMS02E09,5,0,"The episode contains a single, brief but significant scene in which abortion is directly discussed: April, who is pregnant and facing possible fetal abnormalities due to her tuberculosis medication, is urged by her partner Tate to at least consider termination for the sake of her health and the baby's quality of life. April, however, immediately states her Catholic beliefs and refuses to consider abortion. The conversation is emotionally charged and acknowledges both the medical risks and the moral/religious convictions involved. Importantly, the episode does not resolve the issue, advocate for a particular choice, or frame either position as clearly right or wrong. The scene presents both the pro-choice (Tate's concern for health and quality of life, openness to discussing abortion) and pro-life (April's religious conviction and immediate refusal) perspectives without privileging one over the other. The rest of the episode does not return to the abortion topic or use it for narrative advocacy. Thus, the overall stance is neutral/balanced, as it explores the conflict and acknowledges the legitimacy of both perspectives without clear bias.","The episode does not frame abortion as ethically inadmissible or subordinate the pregnant individual's needs to fetal moral status. While April's pro-life stance is clear, the narrative gives equal space to Tate's concerns and does not portray abortion as unthinkable or morally wrong, which would be necessary for a -1 or lower score.","The episode does not affirm abortion as a right, nor does it frame the pregnant individual's autonomy as overriding all other considerations. The pro-choice perspective is voiced but not endorsed by the narrative, and the episode does not portray abortion as a justified or positive choice. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for +1 or higher."
ER,04,19,ERS04E19,1,+1,"The episode of ER prominently features abortion as a theme, especially in the context of a clinic bombing and the medical aftermath. The narrative presents multiple abortion-related cases: a woman with an incomplete abortion requiring emergency intervention, a pregnant teenager rendered brain dead with debates over sustaining her for the fetus, and a woman seeking an abortion in secret. The dominant stance is moderately pro-choice: the text foregrounds the autonomy and well-being of pregnant individuals, shows staff providing abortion care as standard medical practice, and acknowledges the dangers of restricting access (e.g., references to illegal abortions overseas). Emotional and moral complexities are depicted—one doctor hesitates to complete an abortion due to the fetus's development, and there are scenes of protestors and family conflicts—but the overall orientation is toward validating abortion as a legitimate, context-dependent option. The episode does not vilify abortion providers or patients, and it critiques anti-abortion violence. However, it stops short of unequivocally affirming abortion as a fundamental right or minimizing all fetal considerations.","A lower score (0 or negative) would require the episode to either present abortion in a more morally conflicted or pro-life light, emphasize fetal moral status, or frame abortion as ethically fraught or inadmissible. While the episode acknowledges emotional and moral discomfort, it does not prioritize fetal rights over patient autonomy, nor does it frame abortion as generally wrong or only acceptable in rare cases.","A higher score (+2 or +3) would require the episode to present abortion as an unambiguous right, subordinate fetal moral status almost entirely, and portray abortion as ethically, socially, and personally justified in nearly all circumstances. The episode does not do this: it includes scenes of staff moral hesitation, family members opposing abortion, and does not frame abortion as a simple or universally celebrated choice."
ER,04,19,ERS04E19,2,+1,"The episode features abortion as a central theme, with multiple storylines involving patients at a reproductive clinic, a bombing targeting abortion services, and several characters' direct involvement in abortion procedures and aftermath. The narrative consistently validates the pregnant individual's autonomy and right to choose, showing medical staff providing care without judgment, and supporting patients' decisions to seek abortions. However, the episode also gives space to emotional and moral complexity: a doctor hesitates to complete a late-term abortion, expressing discomfort, and this is discussed openly with a colleague. There are also scenes with anti-abortion protesters, but their views are not foregrounded or presented as dominant. The overall orientation leans toward supporting access to abortion and respecting individual choice, while acknowledging that it can be emotionally challenging for both patients and providers. This matches '+1 (Moderately Pro-Choice)': generally supportive of autonomy and choice, with some acknowledgment of fetal moral status and emotional complexity, but not subordinating individual choice.","The episode does not give primary narrative weight to the fetus's moral status, nor does it frame abortion as ethically inadmissible or predominantly problematic. While some characters express discomfort or moral hesitation, the text does not portray abortion as rare, burdensome, or only justified in extreme cases. The dominant stance is not neutral or pro-life.","The episode does not unequivocally affirm abortion as a fundamental right under all circumstances, nor does it present the fetus's moral status as negligible. There is no strong activist framing or portrayal of abortion as unambiguously justified in every context, as would be required for a '+2' or '+3' score."
ER,04,19,ERS04E19,3,+1,"The episode presents abortion as a legitimate and accessible option, with several characters seeking or undergoing the procedure, and the medical staff providing care without overt judgment or obstruction. The narrative acknowledges the emotional and moral complexity for both patients and providers (e.g., Anna's hesitation during a late-term abortion, Kerry's recounting of unsafe abortions in Africa, and the nuanced conversations with patients about contraception and responsibility). The clinic bombing and its aftermath are depicted as tragic and senseless, with violence against abortion providers and patients clearly condemned. While the episode validates the importance of individual choice and bodily autonomy, it also gives space to characters' ambivalence, discomfort, and the gravity of the decision, rather than presenting abortion as an unproblematic or universally celebrated right. This places the episode in the '+1' (Moderately Pro-Choice) category: it leans toward supporting autonomy and contextual justification for abortion, but does not strongly subordinate fetal considerations or frame abortion as an unequivocal right in all circumstances.","The episode does not primarily emphasize the fetus's moral status, nor does it frame abortion as ethically inadmissible or predominantly focus on pro-life arguments. The emotional and social needs of the pregnant individuals are foregrounded, and the right to choose is respected by the medical staff, which is inconsistent with a neutral (0) or pro-life (-1, -2, -3) stance.","The narrative does not unequivocally affirm abortion as a fundamental right under all circumstances, nor does it minimize the emotional or ethical weight of the decision. Characters express ambivalence, and there are moments of moral struggle (e.g., Anna's inability to complete a late-term abortion, the respectful handling of a patient's desire for privacy). The episode does not present abortion as always ethically, socially, and personally justified, as would be required for a '+2' or '+3' score."
ER,04,19,ERS04E19,4,+1,"The episode depicts abortion in multiple contexts: a bombing at a reproductive health clinic, emergency medical interventions for incomplete abortion, and conversations about abortion's emotional and ethical dimensions. The narrative consistently validates the autonomy of pregnant individuals—patients are treated with respect, their choices are supported, and the medical staff, while sometimes personally conflicted, ultimately prioritize patient care and choice. The episode acknowledges the emotional and moral complexity (e.g., a doctor freezing during an abortion due to personal discomfort, another referencing traumatic experiences with illegal abortions abroad), but the dominant stance is that abortion is a legitimate, contextually justified option. The episode does not minimize the gravity of the decision, but it does not center fetal moral status or present abortion as inherently wrong. Instead, it leans toward affirming the right to choose, while recognizing that it can be a difficult, nuanced decision.","A lower score (0 or negative) would require the episode to either present both sides with strict neutrality or to foreground the fetus's moral status and frame abortion as ethically problematic. While the episode includes some conflicted voices and acknowledges the fetus, these are not dominant; the overall narrative supports patient autonomy and the legitimacy of abortion, which is not compatible with a neutral or pro-life stance.","A higher score (+2 or +3) would require the episode to portray abortion as an unequivocal right, with little to no acknowledgment of fetal considerations or emotional/moral ambivalence. In this episode, there is clear recognition of the emotional weight, some moral struggle among providers, and acknowledgment of fetal life (e.g., concern for fetal heart tones, discussion of viability). The narrative is supportive but not stridently or unambiguously pro-choice."
ER,04,19,ERS04E19,5,+1,"The episode of ER presents abortion as a legitimate medical procedure within the context of a clinic bombing, multiple trauma cases, and several patients seeking or having had abortions. The narrative foregrounds the pregnant individuals' autonomy and emotional experiences: one doctor struggles to complete an abortion due to the advanced gestational age, another patient discusses her reasons for seeking an abortion and the complexities of disclosure to her husband, and the aftermath of the bombing highlights both the dangers faced by providers and the diversity of patient needs. While the episode acknowledges the moral and emotional weight of abortion—such as a doctor's hesitation and a protester's attempt to frame abortion as taking a life—the dominant stance is one of validating the right to choose, centering patient well-being and autonomy. The show does not shy away from the difficult aspects, but it does not subordinate the individual's needs to fetal moral status, nor does it frame abortion as inherently wrong or unacceptable. This aligns with '+1 (Moderately Pro-Choice)': the text leans toward supporting choice, foregrounding personal and contextual factors, but does not present abortion as an unqualified right or minimize all opposing concerns.","A lower score (0 or -1) would require the episode to either maintain strict neutrality or to emphasize the fetus's moral value and the ethical burden of abortion. While the episode does include a doctor who hesitates and a protester who voices strong pro-life rhetoric, these are counterbalanced by other characters' support for patient autonomy, the medical necessity of abortion in an emergency, and explicit pushback against anti-abortion violence. The overall narrative does not give equal or greater weight to pro-life arguments; instead, it recognizes them but ultimately centers the patient's needs and choices.","A higher score (+2 or +3) would require the episode to frame abortion as an unequivocal right, with little or no acknowledgment of fetal moral status or emotional ambivalence, and to strongly advocate for reproductive freedom. The episode does not go this far: it depicts emotional and moral complexity, includes a character unable to perform an abortion due to personal discomfort, and allows for the presence of dissenting voices. There is no unambiguous or activist framing of abortion as always justified or as a fundamental right overriding all other considerations."
GA,03,12,GAS03E12,1,+1,"The episode contains a significant subplot in which Addison reveals she had an abortion. The narrative handles this with emotional nuance, focusing on Addison's feelings of regret, loneliness, and her relationship context, rather than centering on the fetus's moral status or framing the act as inherently wrong. The dialogue validates Addison's autonomy and her reasons for the decision, while also acknowledging the emotional aftermath and complexity. There is no strong condemnation or moralizing; instead, the text leans toward understanding and supporting the individual's choice, fitting the '+1' (Moderately Pro-Choice) category. The episode does not present abortion as an unambiguously positive or fundamental right, but it does treat the choice as legitimate and primarily the woman's to make.","The episode does not foreground the fetus's moral status, nor does it present abortion as ethically burdensome or primarily problematic. It does not frame the act as something to be avoided or as a last resort, which would be necessary for a neutral (0) or pro-life (-1) score.","The narrative does not unequivocally affirm abortion as a fundamental right or treat the fetus's moral status as negligible.

GA,03,12,GAS03E12,2,+1,"The episode contains a significant subplot about Addison having had an abortion, which is discussed openly in dialogue. The narrative treats her decision as a complex, personal one, focusing on her emotional state, her relationships, and her reasons for not wanting to have a child with Mark.

The conversation with Mark further underscores that the decision was personal and complex, but not depicted as shameful or ethically inadmissible. The overall framing is empathetic to the pregnant individual's perspective and validates the legitimacy of her choice, while acknowledging emotional difficulty.

The abortion is not depicted as shameful or morally wrong, nor is there significant narrative pushback or condemnation from other characters. However, the episode does not frame abortion as an unequivocal right, nor does it strongly advocate for reproductive freedom in broader social or political terms.

The narrative foregrounds her autonomy and personal desires—she is clear, consistent, and assertive about not wanting a child, and the script gives her space to articulate her reasoning. While her partner, Owen, expresses strong opposition and emotional distress, the episode does not frame Cristina's decision as morally wrong or selfish; instead, it validates her right to choose, even as it acknowledges the pain and conflict this causes in her marriage.

H,03,12,HS03E12,1,0,"The episode presents a nuanced, balanced exploration of abortion in the context of a rape survivor's pregnancy.

The narrative does not clearly endorse either position; instead, it foregrounds the patient's emotional turmoil, religious beliefs, and need for control, while also giving space to House's skepticism and pragmatic arguments. Ultimately, the patient chooses to terminate the pregnancy, but the episode frames this as a deeply personal, conflicted decision rather than a straightforward affirmation of either side. The text avoids strong bias, instead acknowledging the weight of both perspectives and the absence of easy answers, which aligns with the '0' (Neutral / Balanced) score.","The episode does not predominantly emphasize the fetus's moral status or treat abortion as ethically inadmissible.

H,03,12,HS03E12,3,0,"The episode presents a nuanced, multi-voiced exploration of abortion in the context of a rape survivor's pregnancy.

Both the emotional trauma of the patient and the ethical/moral dimensions are given significant narrative space. The episode neither clearly endorses nor condemns abortion; instead, it foregrounds the complexity, ambiguity, and deeply personal nature of the decision. The patient's eventual choice to terminate is reported matter-of-factly, without narrative triumphalism or condemnation.

Multiple characters openly discuss their own abortions, emphasizing that circumstances should not be required to justify the choice. The episode highlights the negative consequences of abortion restrictions, both medically (patients at risk, clinics closing, unsafe alternatives) and socially (loss of rights, fear for the future). While the moral status of the fetus is acknowledged—especially through the character Michelle, who refuses abortion due to her beliefs—the dominant discourse consistently validates abortion as a moral and responsible option, and the narrative sympathizes with those fighting for access. Dissenting or pro-life perspectives are presented but not foregrounded; they are depicted as obstacles or personal beliefs, not as equally weighted ethical positions.","A +1 (Moderately Pro-Choice) score would require a more ambivalent or context-dependent validation of abortion, with greater emphasis on complexity or acknowledgment of fetal moral status. Here, the episode repeatedly and explicitly affirms the right to abortion, portrays efforts to circumvent legal restrictions as moral, and frames the loss of abortion rights as a profound social harm. The pro-choice stance is not just present but actively championed.","A +3 (Fully Pro-Choice) score would require the episode to present abortion as an unequivocal, fundamental right, with little or no attention to fetal moral status and with near-total narrative alignment behind abortion access in all circumstances. In this episode, while the pro-choice position is dominant, there is still some space given to the deeply held beliefs of pro-life characters (e.g., Michelle's refusal of abortion even at risk to her life), and the emotional and ethical complexity is acknowledged. The text does not wholly dismiss the moral status of the fetus or the legitimacy of opposing views, preventing a +3 rating."
PP,02,08,PPS02E08,6,+1,"The episode presents abortion as a valid, legal medical option and ultimately supports the autonomy of the pregnant individual, particularly through Meg's advocacy and the eventual provision of abortion care to Renee. The narrative gives space to a range of perspectives: Dell expresses strong discomfort and initially shames Renee, Naomi voices personal and professional reservations rooted in her fertility work, and Addison shares her own abortion experiences with both shame and acceptance. However, the dominant stance is one of supporting choice—Meg and Addison both defend the right to abortion, and the episode concludes with Renee returning for her procedure after being supported rather than judged. The emotional and social complexities are acknowledged, and while fetal moral status is mentioned (e.g., Naomi's belief that life begins at conception), it does not override the primacy of individual choice. The overall orientation is validating of abortion as an option when justified by context, aligning with '+1: Moderately Pro-Choice.'","A lower score (0 or negative) would require the episode to either present a balanced, neutral view or to emphasize the fetus's moral status and the ethical burden of abortion. While the text does include dissenting voices and moral discomfort, the narrative resolution and the weight of the story support the individual's right to choose, not a pro-life or even strictly neutral position.","A higher score (+2 or +3) would require the episode to portray abortion as an unequivocal right, with little to no attention paid to fetal moral status or the emotional/social ambivalence surrounding the decision. Here, the episode does not present abortion as unambiguously justified in all circumstances; it foregrounds the emotional difficulty, the diversity of opinions, and the need for support rather than advocacy. The stance is supportive but not strongly activist or absolute."
PP,02,08,PPS02E08,7,+1,"The episode of 'Private Practice' presents abortion as a legitimate, legal medical option and foregrounds the pregnant individual's autonomy and emotional experience. Meg, a doctor who provides abortions, is depicted sympathetically, and the narrative validates the difficulty and necessity of the choice for some women. There is open acknowledgment of differing views among the staff: some are uncomfortable or opposed (e.g., Dell, Naomi), while others are supportive or neutral. The episode includes a scene where a patient is shamed for seeking an abortion, but this is explicitly critiqued by other characters, and the patient ultimately receives care. The script also features women sharing their own abortion experiences, with a focus on removing shame and supporting choice. While the fetus's moral status is mentioned (e.g., Naomi's belief that life begins at conception), it does not override the primacy of the individual's choice, and the overall orientation leans toward validating abortion as a reasonable, context-dependent option. This synthesis fits the '+1 (Moderately Pro-Choice)' criteria: generally supportive of autonomy, acknowledging complexity, and validating the option to end a pregnancy, but not strongly or unequivocally activist.","The episode does not frame abortion as ethically burdensome, nor does it center the fetus's moral status or present abortion as unacceptable or only permissible in rare, extreme circumstances. While some characters express discomfort or opposition, the dominant narrative voice supports the right to choose and critiques shaming or obstruction, which is inconsistent with neutral or pro-life stances.","The episode does not unequivocally affirm abortion as a fundamental right under all circumstances, nor does it portray fetal moral status as negligible. There is no strong, activist framing or explicit advocacy for reproductive rights as seen in +2 or +3. The narrative allows space for ambivalence, dissent, and emotional nuance, rather than presenting abortion as always ethically, socially, and personally justified."
PP,02,08,PPS02E08,8,+1,"The episode presents abortion as a valid, legal medical option and ultimately supports the autonomy of the pregnant individual, particularly through Dr. Meg Porter's willingness to provide abortion services and Addison's open support. The narrative gives voice to a range of perspectives: Dell is openly anti-abortion and expresses discomfort, Naomi is conflicted due to her fertility work and personal beliefs, and Violet and Addison share personal experiences that validate the emotional complexity and legitimacy of abortion as a choice. The episode does not shy away from the emotional and social ramifications, including stigma and judgment, but the dominant stance is one of respect for choice and the right to access abortion, even as it acknowledges dissent within the group. The focus is on supporting patients' decisions and ensuring compassionate care, aligning with a 'moderately pro-choice' (+1) stance.","A lower score (0 or -1) would require the episode to either balance pro-life and pro-choice perspectives equally, or to foreground the fetus's moral status and present abortion as ethically fraught or rare. While dissent and discomfort are shown, the narrative ultimately validates the right to choose and critiques shaming or obstructing patients, which is more supportive than a neutral or moderately pro-life stance.","A higher score (+2 or +3) would require the episode to portray abortion as an unequivocal right, with little to no acknowledgment of fetal moral status, and to frame abortion as ethically justified in nearly all circumstances. Here, the episode recognizes emotional, social, and moral complexities, and includes significant dissent and discomfort among the staff. The narrative does not push a strong activist message or present abortion as unambiguously justified in all cases."
PP,02,08,PPS02E08,9,+1,"The episode presents abortion as a legitimate, legal, and sometimes necessary option, with several characters supporting the right to choose and providing abortion services. The narrative includes a range of perspectives: some characters are unapologetically anti-abortion, others are conflicted, and some share personal stories of having had abortions without shame. The episode validates the autonomy of the pregnant individual (Renee) and ultimately ensures she receives the care she seeks, despite initial judgment and obstacles. However, the text also gives space to dissenting voices (Dell, Naomi), and the emotional and ethical complexities are acknowledged.

PP,02,08,PPS02E08,10,+1,"The episode addresses abortion directly through the storyline involving Meg Porter offering abortion services at Oceanside Wellness, the patient Renee Olsen seeking an abortion, and the ensuing debate among the clinic staff. The narrative foregrounds the pregnant individual's autonomy and the right to choose, with Meg and Addison supporting abortion as a valid medical procedure and emphasizing the importance of not judging women who make this choice. The episode also includes perspectives from characters who are uncomfortable with abortion (e.g., Dell and Naomi), but these are presented as personal beliefs rather than as dominant or overriding moral imperatives. The text validates the emotional and social complexity of the decision, acknowledges the stigma and shame often associated with abortion, and ultimately affirms that supporting the patient's choice is part of professional medical care. This aligns with '+1 (Moderately Pro-Choice)': the overall orientation leans toward validating the option to end a pregnancy when justified by context, with fetal moral status acknowledged but not overriding individual choice.","The episode does not frame abortion as ethically inadmissible, nor does it give primary narrative weight to the fetus's moral status. While pro-life views are voiced (notably by Dell and Naomi), they are not dominant, and the text does not suggest abortion is only acceptable in rare or exceptional cases. The central narrative and resolution support the pregnant individual's autonomy, which is inconsistent with the more restrictive or pro-life stances of 0, -1, -2, or -3.","The episode does not unequivocally affirm abortion as a fundamental right under all circumstances, nor does it minimize or disregard the emotional, social, or moral complexity of the decision.

The narrative acknowledges the emotional weight and complexity of the decision, both for the patient and for the medical staff involved, particularly the resident with religious objections. While the episode includes a character who is initially reluctant to participate due to her beliefs, the dominant stance is that performing abortions is a necessary part of medical training and patient care.
